With this order, the company has, in April so far, announced order wins worth nearly Rs 27,000 crore.\n\nMost of these orders were from clients in the domestic market, including the private sector. The combined value of these orders is estimated between Rs 14,500 crore to Rs 27,000 crore. The company does not disclose exact order values, but shares a range for the same.\n\nAnalysts see these order wins as spill-overs from the quarter ended March, 2020. However, the company stands to gain owing to a large order book and exposure to diverse markets.\n\nThe latest orders received by the company are valued at between Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 2,500 crore, and are related to the setting up of a cement plant, smart data centres and a real estate project. All of these orders are from domestic\n\nThis is the fourth order win that the company has announced in April. The earlier ones included building a regional rapid transit system (RRTS) in Uttar Pradesh, orders related to water management systems in Karnataka, power transmission orders from its overseas markets, an IT infrastructure project from the Indian Army (2500-5000) and a distillation unit project for the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). These orders were together valued between Rs 13,500 to Rs 24,500 crore.\n\n\"Most of the orders that L&T has reported in the last few days are related to the fourth quarter, where customer clearances would have taken longer. Once slippages from the last quarter are over, we do not expect any fresh orders from the private sector in the near term, except for those coming from international markets or from the government sector,” said Renu Baid, vice president - research at IIFL Institutional Equities.\n\nFor the quarter ended December, 2019, L&T’s total order inflow was at Rs 41,579 crore. The company’s outstanding order book was at Rs 3.06 trillion as of December, 2019. In January, the company maintained its full-year guidance of 10-12 per cent growth in order inflow for the full year. The guidance back then, however, did not reflect the Covid-19 and lockdown impact which India saw in March.\n\nBaid expects L&T’s Rs 3.06 trillion order book to put it on a strong footing compared to its peers. “Most capital goods have an order backlog for the next six-nine months, post that there will be concerns on revenue visibility. With a Rs 3 trillion worth of order book, L&T is an outlier, which should keep it occupied for atleast 18-20 months if not more,” she said.\n\nAnalysts at ICICI Securities also expect like L&T to further consolidate the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) markets in terms of tender wins. “Companies having strong balance sheets with minimum leverage will stand to gain given the tight liquidity scenario. Some smaller and marginal players will suffer due to leverage leading to reduction in competitive intensity in some tenders and gradual consolidation by larger players.

We have 160 stores for Spencer’s and another about 34 stores for Nature’s Basket totaling almost about 200 stores.\n\nAt the moment, people are buying a lot more of staples, grocery items, cleaning products, sanitisers, masks and others. As a result, the private label at Spencer’s--Smart Choice--has picked up very well.\n\nThere was a lot of panic buying which happened on the eve and during the lockdown. What is the situation now?\n\nIn the first 3-4 days of the lockdown, people would come and buy enough grocery, which would last them two-three weeks, as they weren’t sure what will happen next, but now the government has given people reason enough for not resorting to panic purchase.\n\nNow we are seeing that people have reduced the buying frenzy and purchasing week-on-week. It is because people now know that there is a continuous supply chain of essential items which is always available.\n\nHow do you see panic buying boosting your revenue?\n\nThe store is a combination of essential as well as non-essential items. We have key non-essentials like homeware, electronic items, clothing and others which we have put off from the store and not allowing consumers to purchase those. So, these items, which technically are higher margin categories, aren’t selling right now\n\nDo you think the momentum in these categories can be maintained in the near term?\n\nAs consumers aren’t able to spend on non-essential items, their purchasing pattern is more skewed towards essential items now. As things ease out, people will start buying items which hitherto they weren’t able to purchase like non-essential stuff so there would be a spike in sales of the non-essential item\n\nAcross the industry we are seeing delivery tie-ups of essential items with aggregators. Has Spencer’s and Nature’s Basket done the same?\n\nWe have done almost 9-10 different tie-ups for delivery of essential items including Uber, Flipkart, Rapido and many others. We were the first company to reach out to these delivery and service proactively and these were all done within the first 2-3 days of the lockdown\n\nDo you intend to take this model forward even after lockdown is lifted?\n\nAt times of Covid-19 spread these tie-ups are definitely here to stay. The idea is to work together now but one needs to revisit these once the situation normalizes and then we can take a call.\n\nOn the technical front, what initiatives have you taken?\n\nWe are launching a new chat-bot which will be ready to go online in the next 3-4 days. It basically is a URL which will ask about the delivery pin code and once it is entered, it will show a list of available stores and a list of items which can be delivered. Once the consumer finalizes it, the chat-bot then shows the delivery person and the available time-slots for delivery. It will be a big game changer.\n\nAcross sectors, planned capex is getting postponed.

This indicates an interest in passive indexing strategies to the extent that that Index Fund NFOs are launching in this market too.\n\nTake, for instance, the currently open Motilal Oswal S&P 500 Index fund or L&T Mutual Fund Nifty50 and Nifty Next50 NFO, which closed on March 31. Pratik Oswal, Head of Passive Funds, Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company, says, \"Passive investing is more in alignment with simplicity. Today, index funds have become a lot more efficient in terms of how they are tracking their benchmarks.\" Should you also go passive? Or should you stick to active funds especially in the current markets?\n\nWhy indexing: Simply put, you purchase a representative benchmark, such as the S&P BSE Sensex, Nifty 50 or an index like the S&P BSE Low Volatility Index. Koel Ghosh, Head of South Asia, Standard and Poor's says, \"The index is created through transparent rules, by independent index providers. There is no individual bias, or a fund manager bias in indexing as a strategy, unlike in active investing. It comes with the advantage of low-cost diversification; here, the single risk concentration is gone. The index is a formula cast in stone; if the market goes down, the index goes down, if it recovers, the index will recover, there are no surprises there.\"\n\nIn a passive investment strategy, you maximise returns by minimising buying and selling. Two common ways to invest in equity markets is to either choose an index fund or an index ETF. The keep thing to remember here is that the objective of passive investing is to mirror the index and not beat the index.\n\nHow to invest: Gaurav Rastogi CEO, Kuvera.in says, \"Index funds have low expense ratios, don't carry any style or fund manager risk and need far less monitoring than active funds.\" The asset allocation of an index fund tries to replicate that of an index but many times index funds have delivered slightly different returns than the index, due to tracking error. Tracking error is the standard deviation of the difference between the returns of an investment and its benchmark. Oswal says, \"We have seen that over the long term, investors who make money usually do two things -- make disciplined regular investments and keep costs low. Over the past few years, index fund expense ratios have gone down dramatically. make sense because they don't underperform the index, and there's never really a reason to churn them.\" You can invest in a lump sum or go for systematic investment plans (SIPs) to buy units of index funds. Ghosh says, \"In an index fund, you get the day-end NAV.\" From a cost point of view, there is no transaction fee and no commission. Rastogi says, \"Studies show that the fund expense ratio is inversely correlated to future fund performance, which works in an index fund's favour.\"\n\nETFs: Units of an ETF replicate an index like the Sensex or the Nifty. Each unit has the same weightage of stocks as the benchmark. Ghosh says \"ETFs do have a lower cost than index funds, but you need a Demat account for an ETF.\" The ETF is listed on the stock exchange; it is traded like a stock, hence it offers better liquidity. Though the returns of an ETF are usually close to that of the index, returns from different ETFs are different.\n\nRastogi says, \"While both are good options, we would recommend Index mutual funds. This is simply because in volatile times, Index ETF can trade at a significant premium or discount to the underlying index, defeating the purpose of having index-linked investments. In March there were days when such ETFs were trading 6-7 per cent away from the underlying index, which we think is a big problem.\"\n\nRemember, the factor that affects the price of an ETF is the demand and supply for the security in the market. Oswal says, \"Investing in ETFs is more suitable for a customer who is taking intraday calls. For a long-term investor, index funds make a lot more sense. They are a lot simpler.\"\n\nActive strategy: Active funds try to beat their benchmarks through careful stock selection, but charge a fee for this effort. Nimish Shah, Head of Investments, BNP Paribas Wealth Management, says, \"Keeping in mind the inefficiency of the Indian markets with respect to those abroad, there are a lot of opportunities here that can be capitalised more by active management.\"\n\nYou can take the help of wealth managers or financial planners to help pick the right funds. Shah says, \"We can shortlist based on performance, risks and fund manager's specialisation characteristics, looking for alpha.\"\n\nThe goal of active money management is to beat the stock market's average returns and take full advantage of short-term price fluctuations. Shah says, \"Another thing to look into is risk-adjusted returns. Most of the good quality actively managed funds have a Standard Deviation lower than that of an index.\" Many experts believe that active fund management is better positioned to do well in volatile markets.\n\nMixed bag: All experts we spoke to said that it always makes sense to have a mixed bag of active and Oswal says, \"Having 20-40 per cent in makes sense, as that's a core portfolio which an investor will never touch for 5, 10, 15 years. Then you can add on the satellite portfolio, with a bunch of active funds.\"\n\nThere's no debate between active or passive. The point is to take advantage of both strategies. Amit Jain, CEO & Co-Founder, Ashika Wealth Advisors, says, \"The 2008 crisis was a financial crisis; this is a sovereign crisis for the developing world. It will have a far deeper impact on India. This started as a health crisis, moved to a financial crisis and can turn to a Geo-Political crisis. There is no single strategy you can rely on, so have a combination of both. It has to be across asset classes, using the right product categories at frequent intervals for the next seven months.\" Jain has recommended his ultra HNI clients seven months' staggered investments in equity savings funds, arbitrage funds and multi-cap funds.", "keywords": ["index", "oswal", "bag", "beat", "active", "etf", "crisis", "volatility", "mixed", "funds", "strategy", "returns", "passive", "fund", "investments"], "summary": "Pratik Oswal, Head of Passive Funds, Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company, says, \"Passive investing is more in alignment with simplicity.\nOr should you stick to active funds especially in the current markets?\nTwo common ways to invest in equity markets is to either choose an index fund or an index ETF.\nActive strategy: Active funds try to beat their benchmarks through careful stock selection, but charge a fee for this effort.\nJain has recommended his ultra HNI clients seven months' staggered investments in equity savings funds, arbitrage funds and multi-cap funds.", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/pf/a-mixed-bag-of-active-and-passive-investments-to-beat-the-volatility-120041700933_1.html", "rss_link": "http://www.business-standard.com/rss/latest.rss", "title": "A mixed bag of active and passive investments to beat the volatility"}, {"authors": ["Bs Reporter"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "The has released refunds amounting to Rs 5,204 crore to 820,000 small businesses, consisting of proprietory firms, trusts and companies, since April 8 to enable them carry out their activities without pay cuts and layoffs due to the situation created by Covid-19.\n\nThe department will issue further refunds of about Rs 7,760 crore as early as possible, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement here.\n\nALSO READ: Health Ministry's containment plan yet to address community transmission\n\n\n\nThe department has issued nearly 1.4 million refunds up to Rs 5 lakh each till date.\n\nThe board reiterated that responses are awaited from regarding reconciliation with their outstanding tax demands in around 174,000 cases.

Akshay made a donation of Rs 25 crore towards the PM-CARES fund. The fact that the amount of donation and where it was going was transparent helped Kumar earn the score.

"The reduction in reverse repo rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 per cent by the Reserve Bank is a significant step but it is important that banks should increase their risk appetite, say economists and analysts.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India on Friday announced a 25 basis points reduction in reverse repo to 3.75 per cent from 4 per cent in order to encourage banks to deploy these surplus funds in investments and loans in productive sectors of the economy.\n\n\"The reduction of reverse repo is significant but it needs to be seen if the flow to the private sector actually increases,\" Care Ratings Chief Economist Madan Sabnavis said.\n\nDBS Bank India Economist Radhika Rao said the reduction in the reverse repo rate is meant to prod banks to consider lending activity rather than park funds with the central bank.\n\nALSO READ: RBI move to cut reverse repurchase rate fuels rally in short-term bonds\n\n\"Given the still sizeable funds that is being parked with the central bank under the reverse repo operations even after the 90 basis points cut in March, points to the limited credit and risk appetite of financial institutions,\" Rao said, while cautioning that a further reduction might disincentives banks to utilise the reverse repo window.\n\nSBI's Group Chief Economic Advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh said the RBI has excluded the accounts availing moratorium from the 90-day NPA norm, thus providing a breather to banks as well as customers.\n\n\"However, given the working capital challenges it is advisable for the RBI now to relook at the 90-day norm,\" he said.\n\nGhosh said once an account is classified NPA, the borrower will not be able to raise funds from any other lender.\n\n\"In the current circumstances the only way to save the economy and the financial system seems to be a relaxation of the IRAC norms i.e extending the 90-day schedule to 180 days,\" he said.\n\nGhosh, however, said this relaxation should be given along with a well laid out calendar of returning to the current norm of 90 days in the next two years, by which time hopefully the Covid-19 crisis would have subsided.\n\nRBI also announced targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO 2.0) for an aggregate amount ofRs 50,000 crore, to begin with, in tranches of appropriate sizes.\n\nThe funds availed under this will have to be invested in investment grade bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures of NBFCs, with at least 50 per cent of the total amount availed going to small and midsized NBFCs and MFIs.\n\nKPMG India Partner and Head (CFO Advisory) Sai Venkateshwaran said \"the TLTRO 2.0 for a total of Rs 50,000 crores, will provide some of the much needed liquidity for NBFCs, that have been faced with a significant ALM mismatch as they haven't benefited from the grant of moratorium announced by RBI earlier.\"\n\nRBI also announced providing special refinance facilities for a total amount of Rs 50,000 crore to Nabard, Sidbi and NHB to enable them to meet sectoral credit needs.\n\nCrisil Ratings Senior Director Krishnan Sitaraman said the twin funding measures announced by RBI will definitely provide some relief to NBFCs / HFCs / MFIs who have been providing moratorium on their loans to borrowers but were facing uncertainty in obtaining moratorium on their bank loans.\n\n\"At the same time the fact that no formal announcement was made on applicability of bank loan moratorium to NBFCs would be a dampener for them,\" he said.\n\nAccording to EY India's Economist and Chief Policy Advisor D K Srivastava, the two measures -- reduction in reverse repo and increase in the state governments' WMA limits by 60 per cent of the original limit -- would facilitate increase in economic activities as the lockdown is progressively eased.\n\nRBI further said in respect of all accounts for which lending institutions decide to grant moratorium or deferment, and which were standard as on March 1, 2020, the 90-day NPA norm shall exclude the moratorium period, that is there would be an asset classification standstill for all such accounts from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO READ: RBI's measures welcome, but govt has to bail out small companies: India Inc\n\n\"With the objective of ensuring that banks maintain sufficient buffers and remain adequately provisioned to meet future challenges, they will have to maintain higher provision of 10 per cent on all such accounts under the standstill, spread over two quarters, i.e., March, 2020 and June, 2020,\" RBI said.\n\nAccording to Icra Ratings Senior Vice President and Group Head (financial sector)Karthik Srinivasan, the proposal for 10 per cent provisions on the accounts under the standstill on asset classification because of moratorium is likely to significantly increase the credit provisions for the banks.\n\n\"With an estimate of 3-4 per cent of the bank credit being in overdue category, i.e. SMA 1 and SMA2, which currently requires provision of only 0.4 per cent, the provisioning requirements of banks can increase by Rs 300-400 billion because of the proposed regulations,\" he said.\n\nDeloitte India's Economist Rumki Majumdar said the ability to grant relaxed NPA classification to borrowers and excluding NPA classification from the moratorium period will encourage NBFCs to lend to MSMEs without worrying about the impact such lending may have on their NPAs, which have been high.\n\nAccording to Covestro India's Head of Finance Avinash Bagdi, the bold steps taken by RBI to ensure smooth functioning of banks and financial

You may not want to visit your diabetologist even if he is a few kilometres away, because you simply don't want to expose yourself to the dreaded Covid-19 infection. What do you do?\n\n\n\nDon't fret. You can get quality advice right within the confines of your home, through a mechanism called All you need is a smart phone to start consulting health specialists over video call, phone call, whatsapp, and other applications.\n\n\n\nhas been around for quite a while in India, but it is only recently -- on March 25, in fact -- that the health ministry issued guidelines on its practice in the country. The Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent have also provided an impetus to the form of medical consultation.\n\n\n\nThe fear of contracting infections in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic has kept people from visiting hospitals physically and has prompted them instead top consult their doctors on video, phone and internet-based platforms like web, chat and apps. Little wonder then, that has got a shot in the arm with the likes of Medicity in Gurugram, which has seen a ten-fold surge in average daily remote consultations while Practo has registered a 100 per cent increase week-on-week, and Portea Medical has been receiving 100 Covid-19 related queries a day.\n\n\n\nMedicity has been offering telemedicine to domestic and international patients for the past five years through its Medanta e-clinic app and telemedicine portal. Says Pankaj Sahni, CEO, Medanta: “I have been a strong proponent of telemedicine. But just recently, several things have come together to make it happen on such a scale. The guidelines issued by the Health Ministry, the Covid-19 pandemic, smart phone penetration and the presence of sophisticated technology such as 3G, 4G and even 5G with high definition cameras have all improved the whole experience of communication over a video call exponentially.\n\n\n\nThe public has been ready for this for quite some time and those who were hesitant -- doctors and patients alike -- are being forced to take the plunge because of the pandemic.”\n\n\n\nWhere telemedicine is useful\n\n\n\nTeleconsult is especially popular for lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic endocrinological disorders like hypothyroidism, which need regular check-ups. This can be done remotely as quite often there is some dosage adjustment based on reports and telemedicine can be a great tool for time management for both, doctor and patient. Mental health is another big area, what with the social stigma associated with “seeing” a psychiatrist.\n\n\n\nThere is high demand for 'second opinions' in telemedicine, especially for ailments such as cancer. For hospitals that have super specialists, there is a huge emerging doctor-to-doctor consult where, say, a general physician is able to take advise from an oncologist or nephrologist.\n\n\n\nTelemedicine also works well for patients who return to their homes in smaller towns or villages after taking treatment in larger cities like Mumbai or Delhi, as subsequent follow up can be done remotely. Says Sahni of Medanta, “If you take a few cities away from the country, you don’t have enough doctors and definitely not many super specialists. Telemedicine enables people to reach out to the doctors much easily, saving the collateral cost of travel, stay, commute, time, taking leave from work for both, the patient and the caregiver.”\n\n\n\nForty per cent of the teleconsults on the Practo platform are currently happening from tier-2 and tier-3 cities. It has had several queries on fever, cough, cold, sore throat and body ache, which have gone up three-fold, apart from specific areas such as mental health, paediatrics, gynaecology and dermatology. “Most of these come from people in the 25-40-year age group, with 35 per cent of the consultations being from women,” says Alexander Kuruvilla, Chief health strategy officer, Practo. “We’ve increased our doctor base by close to 50 per cent during the past 4-5 weeks so that access is not a concern for Indians. We’re continuing to help get more doctors onboard our teleconsult platform.”\n\n\n\nThe fear of touching contaminated surfaces or getting infected through another person is high and people are wary of visiting medical facilities and clinics for examination or regular treatments. According to Meena Ganesh, MD and CEO, Portea Medical, “We have seen a sudden increase in the number of calls and chats we are responding to. The chatbot that we launched in association with the Goa Government has received more than 1.5 million queries on Covid-19. Awareness is definitely on the rise and the Central Government also recently recognised this and released guidelines on telemedicine.” She believes telemedicine will play a major role in supporting the conventional healthcare system in India and “we will see the segment grow in the next couple of years”.\n\n\n\nWomen and child health care is traditionally viewed as an 'in-person' consult area. But now, at hospitals such as Nova IVF Fertility, most of the consultations happen remotely, especially the preliminary consultation for new patients or the follow-ups for existing ones. \"One saves on multiple visits,\" says Shobhit Agarwal, CEO, Nova IVF Fertility. \"Only when “the patient needs Ultrasound and some pathological testing does he have to visit the consultant at the clinic.”\n\n\n\nLikewise, Motherhood Hospitals, which caters to pregnant women and children, is getting 200 consultations through video calls, and 30-40 pharmacy orders a day. \"The teleconsult process is a replication of our regular process of appointment booking,\" says Vijayarathna Venkatraman, CEO, Motherhood Hospitals, Bengaluru. “Our mode of consultation is video consultation. Customers must log on to our website or contact our call centre to book a video consultation appointment. After the consultation, the customer receives a copy of the prescription via email. We also have offered e-payment modes payment methods of UPI like Phone Pe, Bhim UPI, Paytm, and netbanking. So, it’s a frictionless approach combining e-consult, e-prescription and e-payment.”\n\n\n\nTech infrastructure\n\n\n\nAll you need is a smart phone and you are good to go. According to Dheeraj Jain, Founder, Redcliffe Life Sciences, “Basic facilities like availability of high-speed internet and video conferencing through webcam or smartphone are adequate, if the doctors need to advise patients on minor ailments such as cough, cold or check their diagnostic reports to prescribe medicine.\"\n\nHe adds, \"Before Covid-19, the telemedicine industry was growing at CAGR of 16.8 per cent and global telemedicine market was expected to cross the $56 billion mark by 2023. Now we might see it cross that figure much earlier.\"\n\n\n\nTechnological development is leading to the creation of advanced gadgets and remote monitoring healthcare devices that can help the doctor access the vitals of the patient such as blood pressure readings, ECGs, and SPO2 levels. There are plenty of plug-in devices and technologies available today, such as digital stethoscope, remote ECG and X Rays, and special medical cameras that doctors can use for a throat or ENT examination.\n\n\n\nPreferred form of communication\n\n\n\nMost patients opt for video calls. “Out of 100, let’s say 60 is video and 40 would be phone call. I would say that the least popular is offline consultations through email and e-clinic application but video is the most popular,” says Medanta’s Sahni.\n\n\n\nToday, many technology-enabled health care platforms cater to the growing demand of telemedicine. Typically, they get a registered practitioner which the Health Ministry guidelines describe as “a person who is enrolled in the State Medical Register or the Indian Medical Register under the Indian Medical Council Act 1956.’ [IMC Act, 1956].” According to Saurabh Arora, Founder & CEO Lybrate, “We provide the bandwidth, the ability to collect payments for doctors and a way to manage patient queue with an online appointment scheduler and medico legal guidelines that protect medical fraternity. Also, the prescription is generated online.”\n\n\n\nPayments in teleconsulting are made through multiple gateways such as credit and debit cards, UPI, bank transfer and e-wallets.\n\n\n\nCompetitive Pricing\n\n\n\nTele-consultations are 10-20 per cent cheaper than in-person, because people are still getting used to the idea. Apps and hospitals are trying to woo their customers and currently the likes of Practo have plans, starting at Rs 399 a month for unlimited online consultations with doctors across 20-plus specialities. In certain apps such as Lybrate, a premium is charged for video and audio call while consultations over text cost less. Experts however feel that over time, there will be no difference in consultation fees.\n\n\n\nAge is no longer a barrier as most patients are comfortable with phone or WhatsApp calls. Even the elderly with very little technical grasp can easily use their phones and if there is an issue, they can be assisted by their tech-savvy children or grandchildren.\n\n\n\nLimitations and challenges\n\n\n\nAccording to Ganesh of Portea Medical, “The limitations pertain only to situations where treatment requires the patient and doctor to be physically present at a place. For example, medical emergencies, surgical procedures, attending to injuries or administering IV drugs, are not possible through telemedicine. In such cases, home healthcare is a great option, since it reduces the risk of hospital-acquired infections and also ensures timely treatment.”\n\n\n\nThere are several procedural and functional issues that the industry is in the process of addressing, one such being reimbursement. Says Dheeraj Jain, “Most insurance providers don’t cover telemedicine expenses as there are no clear guidelines related to it in many countries.”\n\n\n\nThe benefits of telemedicine are many and the biggest is that it allows for continuity of care. Says Sahni of Medanta, “This is a watershed moment as it allows to intervene early and decrease the severity of disease. Also, the data that it throws up can be used for analytics and predictive modelling.”", "keywords": ["phone", "times", "lockdown", "critical", "advice", "health", "patients", "covid19", "using", "doctors", "video", "consultations", "telemedicine", "patient", "medical"], "summary": "The Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent have also provided an impetus to the form of medical consultation.\nMedicity has been offering telemedicine to domestic and international patients for the past five years through its Medanta e-clinic app and telemedicine portal.\nSays Pankaj Sahni, CEO, Medanta: “I have been a strong proponent of telemedicine.\nHe adds, \"Before Covid-19, the telemedicine industry was growing at CAGR of 16.8 per cent and global telemedicine market was expected to cross the $56 billion mark by 2023.\nFor example, medical emergencies, surgical procedures, attending to injuries or administering IV drugs, are not possible through telemedicine.", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/pf/using-telemedicine-to-get-critical-medical-advice-in-times-of-the-lockdown-120041701165_1.html", "rss_link": "http://www.business-standard.com/rss/latest.rss", "title": "Using telemedicine to get critical medical advice in times of the lockdown"}, {"authors": ["Neha Alawadhi"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "Uber and Medlife, an e-health platform, are collaborating to provide residents of five cities access to prescription and other over-the-counter medicines, as the India stays under lockdown until May 3 to contain the coronavirus, said the cab-hailing company on Friday.\n\nUber will use its network of driver partners to support in delivering medicines safely at doorsteps in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Lucknow and Pune.\n\n“We are pleased to announce our partnership with Medlife--our first with an online pharmacy platform--to support last-mile delivery of prescription and other medicines.

Overseas and here, auction houses are capitalising on the fact that collectors are stuck at home — and are online. International auction house Sotheby’s is moving live sales to online-only auctions, or pushing them to a later date, depending on what makes best sense for the category.\n\n“In 2019 alone, Sotheby’s sold $250 million worth of fine art and luxury goods to online bidders across a mix of live and dedicated online sales. Of this, $80 million was achieved by 9,000 lots sold in 129 dedicated online auctions — 55 per cent higher than 2018, with multiple works selling for over $1 million,” says Edward Gibbs, chairman, Sotheby’s India.\n\nIn March, by when several countries had already declared various degrees of lockdown, Sotheby’s conducted 14 online auctions across categories that included wine, contemporary African art, jewels, 20th-century Middle Eastern Art, and others, totalling $24 million — that was more than a quarter of what Sotheby’s total online sales amounted to in 2019 achieved in just one month, says Gibbs. “Now, 25 more online sales have been planned for April, including the weekly online watch auction, presented in a rolling sale format with a new selection of watches being unveiled every seven days.”\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO READ: The cathartic and unifying art that is being created in confinement\n\nMumbai-based Saffronart, which started out as an online auction house, has conducted four art and jewellery sales in the last month alone, generating around Rs 5.75 crore, says Dinesh Vazirani, its founder. “After the financial crisis that roiled markets globally in 2008, it took the art world some seven years to recover. The learning was to be prepared through other sales channels, across price points and mediums,” he says. His point is that with remote technology and cloud connectivity, most auction houses are equipped to reach their customers one way or the other.\n\nSonal Singh, managing director of Christie’s India, says the auction house is also looking at conducting what it calls its “auctions in a box”. Think of a regular art auction in a brick-and-mortar facility complete with artworks and auctioneer, but no seated audience. “The audience will be tuned in digitally, and watching and bidding,” says Singh. Online sales accounted for $270 million of Christie’s total sales of around $7 billion in 2019.\n\nOnline buyers make for almost 64 per cent of Christie’s total clientele, says Singh. In a company announcement, Christie’s EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) President Dirk Boll said: “Alongside the existing calendar of sales announced earlier last week, we have moved from a scheduled nine sales to 40 online across April and May. The topics range from jewels, handbags, watches, collector sales, photography, science and natural history to all parts of modern and contemporary arts.”\n\nThe other channel to take priority will be “private sales”, which are continuing to drive business for the bigger auction houses.\n\nChristies’ new, enhanced “private sales” site offers viewing and purchase options for collectors of fine and decorative arts, jewellery and watches. And a refreshed calendar of online sales provides collectors with continued opportunities to bid and buy. A Sotheby’s spokesperson in London says that besides online sales, its private sales are a vibrant side to the business and had fetched around $1 billion last year.\n\n“There is an unmistakable continued appetite for buying art and for new buyers to enter the market place. Around 25 per cent of buyers in recent sales have been new to the company and, in some sales, this figure has been as high as 50 per cent,” says Gibbs.\n\nHowever, given the Covid-19 pandemic, Sotheby’s has decided to cancel its “Boundless: India” sale in Mumbai in November. Gibbs clarifies, “Sotheby’s has no intention of closing its office or operations in India. There will be an India art-focused auction in September this year.”\n\nDoes all this mean that the traditional art auction, with champagne and hors d’oeuvres and the excitement of watching a tussle between two bidders live, is a thing of the past? “I think it will return in due course,” says Vazirani. “People are social by nature, but we need to give it three to six months.”", "keywords": ["online", "million", "sothebys", "sales", "dampened", "cent", "moving", "art", "india", "auction", "collectors", "entirely", "havent", "theyre", "christies"], "summary": "“In 2019 alone, Sotheby’s sold $250 million worth of fine art and luxury goods to online bidders across a mix of live and dedicated online sales.\nThink of a regular art auction in a brick-and-mortar facility complete with artworks and auctioneer, but no seated audience.\nOnline sales accounted for $270 million of Christie’s total sales of around $7 billion in 2019.\nAnd a refreshed calendar of online sales provides collectors with continued opportunities to bid and buy.\nA Sotheby’s spokesperson in London says that besides online sales, its private sales are a vibrant side to the business and had fetched around $1 billion last year.", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/art-sales-haven-t-been-entirely-dampened-they-re-just-moving-online-120041701608_1.html", "rss_link": "http://www.business-standard.com/rss/latest.rss", "title": "Art sales haven't been entirely dampened, they're just moving online"}, {"authors": ["Peerzada Abrar"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "E-commerce such as Flipkart, Amazon, and are launching initiatives to motivate their network of sellers as they get ready to resume operations, especially for selling non-essential goods.

I could have my own little adventure, right here, slumped across my bookshelves. I could, in an instant, become Kimball O’Hara from Kipling’s 1901 classic — that orphaned “Little Friend of all the World”, that loveable chela of a Tibetan lama, who accompanies him in his quest for the mythical River of the Arrow. Or, I could travel on the steamer Mongolia, on my way to Bombay via the Suez Canal, with Phileas Fogg and his valet, Passepartout, in Verne’s breathless novel, originally published in French in 1872. I could choose to get tossed around on the Mongolia, or I could run away to the Yorkshire moors, with Catherine Earnshaw and her Byronic, gypsy-cur of a companion, Heathcliff, through Brontë’s 1847 gothic tale of fierce love and revenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO READ: How isolation and WFH have deepened our engagement with work and people\n\nThe possibilities of escaping the confines of my room, or indeed my city, during a lockdown are endless: via boats and steamships, trains, sail-powered sledges, barouche-landaus, gigs, and two-wheeled chaises, which take one through the rough waters or dark alleys of adventure, intrigue, and romance.

Returning from India several years later, where he had been impressed by meditation rooms he saw, he added a private office that no one was allowed to enter. His mornings were spent writing in that space and his afternoons in meditation or in walks in the countryside. In Deep Work, a call to arms to block the distractions of email and social media in order to do thoughtful, original work, Cal Newport begins his book with this description of Jung’s aerie being critical to his productivity and well-being. When he was CEO of Microsoft, Newport reminds us, Bill Gates would occasionally take a break from the office and family for so-called “Think Weeks”.\n\nIn a sense, more than a month of social distancing and working from home for those fortunate enough to be able to do so gives us an opportunity to recreate rough facsimiles of the conditions Jung tried to create — and to work and entertain ourselves in ways that mark a sharp break from the past. The pandemic and the lockdowns around the world are a terrible tragedy and will lead to a recession in India and abroad. More than 146,000 have lost their lives worldwide. Millions are out of work. Without adequate safety nets, our migrant workers are among the worst off. Among my pile of newspapers is one with a photograph of a 30-something man carrying his son on his shoulders among a dozen migrants walking along a highway. He wears a smart yellow and blue and white checked shirt and jeans and a belt. He could be one of us — but for his penetrating eyes, which see through all the falsehoods of our unashamedly unequal republic.\n\nALSO READ: How a bunch of outfits are still getting organic produce to your doorstep\n\nTo paraphrase the Financial Times columnist Lucy Kellaway, against such a backdrop of misery, is it acceptable to try to be happy? Yet, it is important to be optimistic — if we are lucky enough to have a choice— rather than perpetually anxious about such dubious concerns as disinfecting groceries and vegetables.\n\nIndeed, Covid-19 and its aftermath are an opportunity to significantly reorient the way we approach work and leisure — and, by extension, life itself. As the philosopher Seneca observed in his essay, “On the Shortness of Life”, “I cannot doubt the truth of that oracular remark …’It is a small part of life we really live.’ Indeed, all the rest is not life but merely time.” As our world slows down, I have had conversations with friends that have a quality quite different from those before the Age of Covid and remind me of the languid story-telling of the 1980s’ Kolkata of my late teens. Last week, a friend, who is a novelist, told me of his wife giving birth late last year before her doctor had arrived at the hospital in such horrifying and hilarious detail that I felt as if I were with them, almost to the doors of the delivery room. I recently called a friend’s 83-year-old mother, who had been an important influence on my reading when I was in college in Delhi. She had just completed the third of Hilary Mantel’s Thomas Cromwell-Henry VIII trilogy. By coincidence, I have spent part of the relishing every sentence of the second volume, Bring Up the Bodies.\n\nFriends are writing long, newsy emails again, much like the letters one wrote decades ago. A friend’s travel business that focused exclusively on Italy has been destroyed over a matter of weeks by the pandemic. Yet, this week she wrote me a note, not of her troubles but full of gratitude among other things for a dinner at a noisy restaurant we had been to together 15 years ago with the legendary travel writer Jan Morris, now 93. She couldn’t help adding news of her husband, “(He) has a thick black beard and is channelling Che Guevara. NOT GOOD.”\n\nFreed from the staccato, telegram-like communication that characterised email pre-Covid, I have found myself emailing ex-bosses and ex-colleagues after a decade of inexcusably not being in touch. One taught me more 25 years ago than I learned in journalism school about the discipline that a short preparatory outline imposes on articles — and the tendency to meander without one. Writing to a boss from the early 2000s, who many of us worshipped because her irreverent wit and sense of fun lit up the office, I remind her of a juvenile gift I gave her years ago. It was a pink pen with a ridiculous faux flamingo feather, sent in by some more than usually dopey public relations firm, which she sportingly took to a weekly newspaper management meeting for months afterward. “How could I ever forget that pen?!” she instantly replied, as if it was from Tiffany.\n\nLaurie Santos, the Yale University psychology professor whose popular course on happiness is available free on Coursera, argues that routinely counting our blessings and expressing gratitude is an important foundation for well-being. Good humour helps. In the past month, I have found myself forwarding an extract from Morris’ recently published book, Thinking Again, which is so jauntily cheerful that no one could read it and remain downcast.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph’s headline summed up her world-view: “Let’s say ‘Go to hell to the whole caboodle’: Her partner has dementia, the country’s a mess, the milk has gone sour yet Jan Morris finds reasons to be cheerful.” The generation gap with her computer gets her down, but only momentarily: “Who is the Server who declines to serve me on my screen this morning?”\n\nI have not owned a television for more than a decade, which leaves me, amid these unsociable Covid evenings, mostly addicted to the Technicolored, high-intensity workouts of the Kiwi company Les Mills that are available online, in books and on Twitter. On Twitter, I have fallen down the Alice in Wonderland rabbit-hole of following virologists and scientific experts. I had a late dinner this week because I had worked my way through a thread by @PeterKolchinsky that ran more than 2,000 words in which he likened antibodies to police dogs and the surface protein on our cells that SARS-CoV-2 uses to get into our cells as “door handles”. After becoming similarly entranced by the Twitter feed of a London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine professor @AdamJKucharski, I signed up for a free online course on Covid-19 offered by the school. I am two weeks behind on coursework but the world will likely be grappling with this well into 2021 so I have time. I have also spent an hour a week via Zoom in conversation with the worldly 10th and 12th grade students of Neev Academy, an International Baccalaureate school in Bengaluru, discussing the media and Covid-19.\n\nInevitably perhaps, my viewing has declined, in large part because there is so much else that has been put on free to view. In the past week, the Berlin Philharmonic aired two Easter concerts. They were introduced by orchestra members who stood more than the requisite six feet apart and lamented not being able to play together. In an unforgettable video clip of the great Italian conductor Claudio Abbado’s first rehearsal with the orchestra, there is a moment of delicious confusion when the musicians in the horn section jump up to play their part in the third movement of Mahler’s First Symphony. A bemused Abbado stops conducting. Then, apparently worried he might have offended his musicians, he gently says that, for the horn players to stand was the practice during Mahler’s time but in today’s world it is perhaps a bit too much. The clip from 1989 is a timeless example of good management. Memorable in a different way was the release of a 2012 production of Jesus Christ Superstar, set against anti-capitalism protests with Christ as a punk rock star.\n\nAn endless succession of days when we are not even allowed to walk a few feet apart in a park to enjoy the impossibly blue skies perhaps makes us more receptive to such moments, on screen and off. It is akin to what is called “altitude weeping”, the tendency to tear up more easily while watching a film on a plane. Even doing housework has its moments. Washing dishes the other day — and never has the sink filled up quite so quickly — I found myself laughing out loud and then in tears listening to a TED talk by the great American biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin. She was describing with such enjoyment working with Lyndon Johnson, first as a White House intern and then on his biography, and of her respect for Abraham Lincoln, that it was hard not to feel nostalgic and grateful for an age when prime ministers and presidents were extraordinary men and women, not made-for-TV politicians.\n\nVacuuming and dusting also yields treasures when not outsourced to a much more efficient part-time cleaner. I chanced upon a poem of Vikram Seth’s written in my late mother’s elegant handwriting. The first few lines read: “How rarely all these few years, as work keeps us aloof, Or fares, or one thing or another, Have we had days to spend under our parents’ roof.” (After my father died a decade ago, I discovered he had a photocopy of the poem folded into his wallet.) Circa 2020, the verses are a reminder that the travel so many of us took for granted is unnervingly uncertain for the foreseeable future. My Google calendar alerted me to the fact that my eldest brother and sister-in-law were to arrive on an annual visit to Bengaluru on April 15. Instead, he is locked down in California and she, having come early to Nagpur where her eldest sister lives, was unable to get to Mumbai in time to catch a special flight home early this week. These days, such dislocation seems routine.\n\nYet, at a time of misery borne disproportionately by India’s poor and by medical staff who lack protective equipment, adding this as a postscript amounts to the opposite of empathy. Hundreds of thousands of India’s workers are still stranded; millions will go to sleep with less food than before, including that migrant with his son on his shoulders and eyes staring out of a photograph in this paper in an indictment of us all. “This disease is not a great leveller. Those working on the frontline — bus-drivers and (supermarket) shelf stackers, nurses and care-workers, shopkeepers and hospital staff — are more likely to catch the disease because they are more exposed. Those in manual jobs will be unable to work from home,” said the BBC Newsnight anchor Emily Maitlis earlier this month as she called for a “social settlement… to be put in place to stop inequality becoming even more stark”.

After the lockdown, it has added 5,000 to its existing customer base of 12,000.\n\nKrishi Cress’s produce\n\nThis is partly down to supply constraints in the — not every new customer is looking specifically for organic, chemical-free fruits and vegetables. “As big brands including online players with long supply chains faced uncertainty over delivery, many found us a dependable option,” adds Chakravarty. Farmizen has a network of partner farms in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, going beyond a buy-sell relationship. Unlike big players that focus on customer convenience, as slot-based deliveries would suggest, a start-up like Farmizen operates in a resource-constrained way and works closely with farmers. In a post-Covid-19 scenario, practices such as community-based buying with fixed delivery timings may become a preferred option.\n\nThe pandemic has also forced farms that worked with the hospitality industry to turn directly to consumers. Krishi Cress, a farming initiative in Delhi that grows vegetables, edible flowers and microgreens, and makes preserves, took a hit with cafes and restaurants downing shutters. By mid-March, Krishi Cress began to focus on marketing immunity-boosting products to consumers. These include nutrient-rich leafy greens such as kale, Swiss chard and water cress as well as turmeric and kombucha.\n\n\n\n\n\nA delivery boy with a box of greens\n\nLike everyone else, the farm had to struggle with curfew passes and police blockades initially. But the response from customers has been positive, particularly as they are now more conscious of hygiene and are seeking items that do not change hands and are straight out of the farm, says Achintya Anand, founder of Krishi Cress.\n\nThe chef-turned-farmer opened Krishi Cress in 2014 and supplied exotic vegetables to top-tier restaurants in the capital. Apart from two farms and a dispatch and packaging unit in Chhatarpur, Krishi Cress has a farm in Faridabad that cultivates ordinary vegetables, also all organic. It also sells products from Darima Farms, which has an artisanal cheese factory near Mukteshwar in Uttarakhand.\n\n\n\nPushing for purity of produce further is hydroponic farming, which is based on alternative soil like coco peat and nutrient-filled water. Kaze Living, a Delhi start-up launched in January, promotes a chemical-free plant-based diet in urban areas. From different varieties of basil, arugula, bok choy, mixed microgreens and herbs to portobellos and tomatoes, most of the plants it sells have living roots that can survive for a week. “Many customers just put the leftover stem and root in a pot and the plant grows back,” says Shruti Jain, one of the co-founders. With a subscription base of 300, Kaze Living promises to deliver the greens from farm to fork within three hours.\n\nworkers sort vegetables at a partner farm of Farmizen\n\nYodeli, an organic grocery store that curates and delivers fruits and veggies in Mumbai and Bengaluru, similarly sources produce from farms including ones that practise aquaponic farming. A vegetable box with exotic greens and herbs costs Rs 1,650 and lasts a family about a week.\n\nKosara’s community farm in Gurgaon has over 350 subscribers\n\nIn Delhi-NCR, The Altitude Store is delivering to customers from its three outlets in the capital and one in Greater Noida. Although it is well-stocked with fruits and vegetables, it has only chicken in the meat segment. As does popular hormone-free fish and meat supplier\n\n\n\nFreshToHome (its chicken gets sold out quickly too). But, says its CEO, Shan Kadavil, “With fresh guidelines set to ease movement of trucks, we should be able to deliver products across categories in a couple of days.” Meanwhile, South Delhi residents can continue to count on the 25-year-old French Farm on NH-8, which provides organic poultry, pork and vegetables to its loyal clientele.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample of a green plant grown on coco peat sold by Kaze Living", "keywords": ["cress", "krishi", "organic", "products", "farms", "produce", "bunch", "farm", "living", "vegetables", "doorstep", "farming", "outfits", "getting"], "summary": "Since late 2018, Paras Chopra has enabled people to vicariously grow their own organic vegetables in small parcels on his 55-acre farmland in Gurugram.\nKosara, the app-based community farming venture that Chopra set up, is now delivering products within a week of registering new subscribers — those who simply want the organic farm produce.\nBy mid-March, Krishi Cress began to focus on marketing immunity-boosting products to consumers.\nThe chef-turned-farmer opened Krishi Cress in 2014 and supplied exotic vegetables to top-tier restaurants in the capital.\nApart from two farms and a dispatch and packaging unit in Chhatarpur, Krishi Cress has a farm in Faridabad that cultivates ordinary vegetables, also all organic.", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/how-a-bunch-of-outfits-are-still-getting-organic-produce-to-your-doorstep-120041701460_1.html", "rss_link": "http://www.business-standard.com/rss/latest.rss", "title": "How a bunch of outfits are still getting organic produce to your doorstep"}, {"authors": ["Ruchika Chitravanshi"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "Covid-19 cases jumped to 13,835 and 452 deaths with India recording a new record in highest single day jump in confirmed cases, even as the claimed a 40 per cent decline in the growth rate of Covid-19 cases since the lockdown was imposed.\n\nIn the last 24 hours there have been 1,455 more cases, taking India’s total tally close to 14,000.\n\nIndia’s average growth of Covid-19 cases between March 15 and March 31 was 2 per cent.

Projections based on a recent analysis by researchers at the United Nations University (UNU) show that, in the worst case scenario, 104 million more people in India could fall below the World Bank-determined line of $3.2 a day for lower-middle-income countries. At present, 60 per cent of India’s population, or an estimated 812 million people, live below that line.\n\nIn effect, the pandemic and the economic consequences of an extended business shutdown could swell the ranks of India’s poorest to 915 million. From 60 per cent, the proportion of people below the line could increase to 68 per cent – a situation seen in the country more than a decade ago. Much of the Indian government’s efforts to mitigate poverty over the years could be negated in a matter of just a few months.\n\nThe classifies nations into four broad income categories on the basis of which they are assigned three poverty lines. The lower-middle-income category, in which India also falls, has countries where per-capita annual gross national income is between $1,026 and $3,995 (between Rs 78,438 and Rs 3 lakh). In these countries, those earning less than $3.2 a day (around Rs 78,000 per year) are considered to be below the poverty line.\n\nUpper-middle-income nations are those where citizens on average earn between $3,996 and $12,375 annually. In these countries, those earning less than $5.5 a day are considered below poverty line. Citizens of high-income nations earn more than $12,375 every year, while low-income nations are those where the per-capita annual income is below $1,026. The World Bank’s standard international poverty line of $1.9 a day is applicable to low-income nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO READ: Covid-19: Asia's growth may see first halt in 60 years in 2020, says IMF\n\nEven if India’s damage were ascertained using an international benchmark for poor economies — poverty line of $1.9 a day (Rs 145 at prevailing exchange rates) — 15 million to 76 million Indians might join the ranks of the poorest in this crisis. In India, which has an annual per-capita income of $2,020 (or Rs 1.5 lakh a year), 22 per cent of the population earns less than $1.9 a day. It would be pertinent to note that this poverty line is much lower than even the minimum wage notified under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), and holding it up like a blade of grass in the wind might position policy makers with their backs to a looming economic storm.\n\nThe UNU study has taken into account three scenarios of per-capita income and consumption decline while making global projections of increased poverty. In the worst-case scenario, researchers have estimated a ‘high contraction’ of 20 per cent in income and consumption — that could lead to an eight per cent rise in poverty in countries where those living below $3.2 (Rs 244) a day are deemed to be poor. According to UN researchers, this ‘high global contraction’ could add 541 million to the global poor in lower-middle-income countries. Two of every 10 persons slipping below the poverty line due to the coronavirus-induced economic crisis could be from India.\n\nThe report notes: “Covid poses a real challenge to the UN Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030 because global poverty could increase for the first time since 1990 and, depending on the poverty line, such increase could represent a reversal of approximately a decade in the world’s progress in reducing poverty. In some regions the adverse impacts could result in poverty levels similar to those recorded 30 years ago.”\n\n\n\nALSO READ: Covid-19: In fight against economic slowdown, RBI introduces new measures\n\nIn the ‘medium contraction’ scenario, in which per-capita income and consumption fall 10 per cent globally, the number of below-poverty-line people in India could rise by 50 million.\n\nIn the ‘low contraction’ scenario, the damage would be restricted to the addition of 25 million people. Naturally, global trends in poverty increases would follow the same pattern. But the impact of the pandemic on poverty could be more severe in South Asia, especially the low- and lower-middle-income countries. It is estimated that two-thirds of the ‘new-world poor’ would be residents of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.\n\nIn more ways than one, this will be bad for India, which has been reeling from sub-par economic growth over the past year, even as the government increasingly relies on welfare measures to win over the poor, fiscally constraining itself in the process.\n\nAn International Labour Organization (ILO) report published earlier this month had dire estimates for India’s employment scenario. With 90 per cent of India’s 500-million workforce engaged in the informal sector, the ILO report estimated that almost 400 million workers could slide deeper into poverty. The report noted: “Current lockdown measures in India, which are at the high end of the University of Oxford’s Covid-19 Government Response Stringency Index, have impacted these workers significantly, forcing many of them to return to rural areas.” If the ILO’s estimates were to come true, this rise in informal-sector could further reduce per-capita income and consumption, making the UNU estimates look like an understatement.\n\nThe ILO estimates that the hardest hit sectors would be retail, food and hospitality, and manufacturing. Official estimates suggest that almost 48 million workers — almost a third of India’s services sector workforce — is engaged in the retail and wholesale sectors. More than 90 per cent of them work in the so-called informal ‘shadow economy’. Another 46 million are estimated to be involved in manufacturing, while the restaurant and hotel industry employs over seven million workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO READ: Covid-19 crisis may drag 400 mn Indian workers further into poverty: ILO\n\nThe construction sector employs over 50 million. The domino effects and the U-shaped gradual economic recovery predicted by many to follow the pandemic could put millions of workers in such sectors at the mercy of the welfare state. The Modi government recently announced a Rs 1.7-trillion ($22 billion) package to bail out the most vulnerable sections of society likely to bear the brunt of the crisis.\n\nAn examination of the cash component of the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana shows that it would be inadequate to prevent the slide of millions in the country below the poverty line due to the present crisis. The amount of cash directly deposited in the bank accounts of 320 million beneficiaries is Rs 29 billion — a per-capita one-time cash assistance of almost Rs 900. This one-time dole would be enough to keep them at the poverty line designated for lower-middle-income countries for four days on an average.\n\nHowever, a section of the most vulnerable beneficiaries of the programme would get even less. For instance, 191 million economically disadvantaged women have received a one-time payment of Rs 500 – enough to keep them at the poverty line for two days. Elderly widows and the disabled have received a similar cash transfer.\n\nThe minimum wage for workers in India’s flagship work programme for the rural poor, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Scheme, has been raised to Rs 202 from Rs 182 — less than the poverty line requirements — although many states pay much higher wages than that notified by the central government. A look at the frontloading of the PM-KISAN scheme, which provides Rs 6,000 a year to farmers, and the one-time payment to 21 million construction workers, show that they would survive at the poverty line for no more than a week with this monetary help.\n\nWhile the government may be constrained by its finances to put more cash in the hands of the distressed, India’s fiscal and monetary policy response to the crisis has been rather muted. Initially, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) assisted states by raising their ways and means advances (WMA) limit by 30 per cent. And that limit was doubled to 60 per cent on April 17. The central bank has injected greater liquidity into the banking system through policy rate tweaks and other measures — that is unlikely to immediately benefit those staring at sliding below the poverty line.\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO READ: Coronavirus outbreak: Why cities may not remain the same after lockdown\n\nOn the brighter side, loan repayment moratoriums for small borrowers and widening of the monetary policy rate corridor could increase cash flows to sitting ducks in the present poverty inducing crisis. The centre has made a one-time transfer of over Rs 17,000 crore to states to tackle the crisis, and various states are now implementing their own welfare schemes to help the poor. Free distribution of food rations by the Centre and states could ease the pain and temporarily slow down the impending spike in the headcount of the poorest.\n\nBut should India’s central bank and the central government be doing more instead of leaving the bulk of the firefighting to states? Lekha Chakraborty and Emmanuel Thomas from the New Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) had raised alarm bells in their analysis a day before PM Modi formally announced an extension of the lockdown. They noted: “It seems that the government and the RBI are adopting a wait-and-watch policy. But, even if the pandemic is tamed in the next couple of months, the hardship it is going to cause to the vulnerable is going to be unimaginable. Some have even said that more people will die of hunger than the pandemic, unless the government wakes up to the situation and addresses the issue on a war footing.”", "keywords": ["income", "impact", "million", "indias", "poverty", "cent", "india", "coronavirus", "line", "poor", "rs", "indians", "day", "100", "fall"], "summary": "In these countries, those earning less than $3.2 a day (around Rs 78,000 per year) are considered to be below the poverty line.\nIn these countries, those earning less than $5.5 a day are considered below poverty line.\nThe World Bank’s standard international poverty line of $1.9 a day is applicable to low-income nations.\nTwo of every 10 persons slipping below the poverty line due to the coronavirus-induced economic crisis could be from India.\nThis one-time dole would be enough to keep them at the poverty line designated for lower-middle-income countries for four days on an average.", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/coronavirus-impact-over-100-million-indians-could-fall-below-poverty-line-120041700906_1.html", "rss_link": "http://www.business-standard.com/rss/latest.rss", "title": "Coronavirus impact: Over 100 million Indians could fall below poverty line"}, {"authors": ["Samreen Ahmad"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "With India facing an acute shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, several domestic firms, starting from toymakers to apparel manufacturers, have now decided to manufacture them.

The report highlights that among the respondents, there was much physical and psychological agony and trauma, and a desperation to return home.\n\nThe report, titled 21 Days and Counting: Covid-19 Lockdown, Migrant Workers, And The Inadequacy of Welfare Measures in India, is based on a survey of 11,159 migrant workers.\n\nIt reveals the ground reality of workers across India over the 21-day period of the lockdown, and shares findings with respect to food, cash and wages, apart from making recommendations to immediately tackle the lockdown and its impact on migrant workers.\n\nWhile the announcement of the lockdown on March 25 caught the entire country off guard, it particularly left little time for the state governments and the bureaucracy to effectively plan for this emergency, and it was especially hard on migrant workers dependent on daily wages. The report notes that while millions of migrants successfully reached their home states, only to be quarantined in camps, many remain stranded far from home, with little money or food.\n\nThis report takes into account 11,159 migrant workers, of which almost 17 per cent are daily wage earners and factory/construction workers, eight per cent are non-group based daily wage earners (such as domestic workers and drivers) and eight per cent are self employed. (vendors, sari workers). The average daily wage of the workers is Rs 402, and the median is Rs 400.\n\nThe findings of the report with respect to food, cash, and wages\n\nA key point made in the report is that the rate of hunger and distress far exceeds the rate of relief provided to the migrant workers. Two weeks into the lockdown, only one per cent of the stranded workers had received rations from the government and three weeks into the lockdown, only four per cent had received rations. Further, the report highlights:\n\n96 per cent had not received rations from the government.\n\n70 per cent had not received any cooked food.\n\n78 per cent have less than Rs 300 left with them.\n\n89 per cent have not been paid by their employers at all during the lockdown.\n\nWages and relief\n\nThe report explains that the union and the state governments are legally bound to record migrant labour under laws such as the National Disaster Management Act (2005), the Interstate Migrant Worker Act (1979), and the Street Vendors Act (2014), among others. There are other wage laws that say that workers are entitled to the payment of full and timely wages, to displacement allowance, a home journey allowance including payment of wages during the journey.\n\nThe lockdown reveals a far more grim picture of the state of contract labour and the lack of accountability on the part of both, employers and the government.\n\nAccording to the report, most of stranded workers were not able to recall the name of the main builder or company they had been working for. They had no social network to tap into at their place of work. Their only link to the city or town in which they were working was through their contractor.\n\nThey were only able to name their contractor, and were even unaware of the name of the registered company with which the contractor was associated. In most cases, contractors had switched off their phones, leaving workers to fend for themselves.\n\nThe report highlights that 89 per cent of the stranded workers had not been paid during the lockdown period by their employers, despite the directive of the Ministry of Home Affairs asking employers to do so.\n\nSeventy four per cent of the migrant workers surveyed had less than half their daily wages remaining for the rest of the lockdown period.\n\nWith barely Rs 200 in hand, they not only had to get their rations in places where food staples or cooked meals were not available, but also had to buy for essentials such as soap, oil, cooking gas, sanitary pads, medicines, phone recharge and transportation cost to return home post lockdown. They had to pay rent (in the range of Rs 2,000-3,000) for their accommodation at a time when they had no income.\n\nCompliance with the relief measures of the government\n\nSo far, over 350 orders have been issued by the union and state governments since the lockdown, to provide relief to the migrants. State governments have announced measures such as shelters and provision of cooked meals at feeding centres. However, these aren't sustainable for 21 days let alone the extension till May 3.\n\nThe report highlights the fact that since millions of stranded workers are not registered, the union government’s announcement of aid to construction workers from the cess collected by labour welfare boards holds little meaning.\n\nThe report also highlights poor compliance with the ministry of Home Affairs' directive on payment of wages, without deduction and with no demand for rent. Only a few state governments have extended relief measures beyond shelters for migrants, such as provision of free rations to non-ration-card holders (as in Delhi's case) and Rs 1,000 cash transfers to stranded migrants.\n\nKey recommendations\n\nThe report proposes a diverse set of recommendations for migrants under different categories, such as (i) those who have returned home, (ii) those trying to reach home but were stopped and sent to relief shelters, (iii) those trying to reach home, were stopped but were not able to reach a shelter and are sleeping on roads and in public spaces, and (iv) those who have been living under miserable conditions in the cities where they work.\n\nThe report makes categorical recommendations on food security, wages and income support, social security, shelters and housing, and transport facilities. It specifies what should be done immediately to manage the crisis, such as doubling the PDS for three months, providing two cooked meals at conveniently located sites, releasing wages for 25 days into Jan Dhan accounts of all urban residents, using schools and empty locations to house migrants, paying full wages of workers in the informal sector, not allowing the closure of hostels, relief camps, and shelters,\n\nnot allowing the eviction of tenants, arrangements for sanitation workers to reach home safely, among many others.\n\nHOW SOME STATES FARED\n\nAccording to the report, the most prompt administrative response so far has been from Karnataka, and the most patchy, from Maharashtra.\n\nUTTAR PRADESH: 1,618 migrant workers reached out\n\nAverage daily wages of Rs 291 are lower than some of the other states.\n\n64 per cent of workers had not received any cooked food from the govt.\n\nIn addition to setting up shelters for migrants, UP govt announced a Rs 1,000 cash transfer for daily wage workers. Not a single person in the survey sample had received any money from the govt.\n\nOn average, people are left with Rs 56, and 87 per cent have less than Rs 200 remaining.\n\nEvery single person said that they would run out of rations within two days.\n\nHARYANA AND DELHI: 1,058 migrant workers\n\nBoth the state govts announced issue of ration coupons to those without ration cards\n\nOne in three people have received cooked food from the govt or a local organisation. More than 82 per cent said that they had rations only for two days.\n\nThe Delhi govt announced Rs 5,000 cash transfers for daily wage earners but because of heavy policing in areas, it became extremely difficult to withdraw money or get rations.\n\nHaryana govt announced that workers registered at the district level portal will be given Rs 1,000 per week. None of the workers who called were aware of this cash transfer.\n\nThe Haryana government, directed commercial establishments to not terminate contracts and pay full wages. However, 84 per cent have not been paid and 76 per cent have less than Rs 300 to survive for the rest of the lockdown period.\n\nMUMBAI AND MAHARASHTRA: 3,992 migrant workers\n\nLess than one per cent of groups have received any rations from the govt.\n\n42 per cent had been able to access some cooked meals either from a local organisation or from the govt.\n\nAlmost 80 per cent of those who reached out are construction workers and 90 per cent said they would run out of rations within 2 days.\n\nPUNJAB: 322 migrant workers\n\nThe state government announced distribution of 10 kg of flour, two kg of pulses and two kg of sugar, door-to-door for daily wage labourers.\n\nWorkers outside Ludhiana had to face police brutality and felt discriminated against in the distribution of food and ration by locals.\n\nPunjab has not announced any financial assistance for workers who are not registered with labour welfare boards.\n\nRation shops run out of ration by the time the poor can access it, because of a general disorganisation and corruption in distribution across large cities.\n\nKARNATAKA: 3,000 workers\n\nThe Karnataka High court ordered the provisions of food packets to daily wage workers affected by the lockdown.\n\nHowever, 93 per cent had not received any ration supplies and 80 per cent had not received cooked food.\n\nOn a positive note, the Principal Secretary, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, has responded with urgency to requests for rations to be delivered in different parts of the state.\n\nBIHAR:", "keywords": ["wages", "rations", "stranded", "lockdown", "89", "cent", "food", "hadnt", "period", "migrant", "received", "workers", "report", "migrants", "paid", "rs"], "summary": "The report, titled 21 Days and Counting: Covid-19 Lockdown, Migrant Workers, And The Inadequacy of Welfare Measures in India, is based on a survey of 11,159 migrant workers.\nTwo weeks into the lockdown, only one per cent of the stranded workers had received rations from the government and three weeks into the lockdown, only four per cent had received rations.\nFurther, the report highlights:96 per cent had not received rations from the government.\nSeventy four per cent of the migrant workers surveyed had less than half their daily wages remaining for the rest of the lockdown period.\nUTTAR PRADESH: 1,618 migrant workers reached outAverage daily wages of Rs 291 are lower than some of the other states.", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/89-stranded-migrants-hadn-t-been-paid-wages-during-lockdown-period-report-120041700786_1.html", "rss_link": "http://www.business-standard.com/rss/latest.rss", "title": "89% stranded migrants hadn't been paid wages during lockdown period: Report"}, {"authors": ["Shivansh Jauhri"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "The (Covid-19) spread is on the rise in the country, and so is the testing of the infections.

As the news spread, the authorities immediately swung into action. Municipal corporation officers and the police reached the stop and carefully took the currency notes in their possession.

The local authorities have issued a token system for smooth running and also deployed 16,000 volunteers to enforce social distancing norms. Not only this, but the farmers, labourers, and agents have also been provided with masks and gloves. Even the trollies are being sanitised. On Thursday itself, around 36,077 metric tonnes of wheat was purchased. The per quintal rate has been fixed at Rs 1,825. The farmers will get their money within 48 hours.

Their commodity is onion and the issue they are facing is the price. Nashik has one of the biggest onion markets in Asia. However, this year has not been good for onion farmers. It started with prohibition on onion exports. The Covid-19 pandemic, which triggered the lockdown, has brought them more grief. Transportation is next to negligible, which is forcing them to sell onion at a very low price, resulting in losses. Since the red onion goes bad in a few days, the farmers are selling it at a paltry price of Rs 7, 10, 20 per kg. This is not even coming at par with the cost incurred. Lasalgaon mandi has become a hub of onion auction at low prices.\n\nTomato prices tank to Rs 2 per kg in Bhopal\n\nIf onions in Nashik were causing pain to farmers, tomatoes in Bhopal did more damage, according to a report in Dainik Bhaskar.

Each kilo of tomato incurs a cost of Rs 3, according to the report. Farmers are forced to either dispose it off or feed it to animals. Similar is the case with vegetables.

This paper had reported that the ministry of power was pursuing states to join hands with private power distributors on franchisee basis to improve their revenues.\n\nThe bill has also put an end to subsidised power rates. It has revised the provision of power tariff determination and proposed that all state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) “to determine tariff for retail sale of electricity without any subsidy under section 65 of the Act”.\n\nThe Bill has also noted that cross-subsidy and surcharges levied on industrial consumers should be reduced. These charges are levied on industrial consumers of a state to cross-subsidise the free or subsidised power given to certain section of consumers.\n\nRecognising that power tariff is not cost reflective and has several subsidy components, the new Bill has introduced provisions on tariff determination.\n\nThe Bill will impose restrictions on deferring revenue recovery or regulatory assets.\n\nRegulatory assets are expenses of power distribution companies (discoms) which are recoverable in future power tariff hikes but the SERCs do not take them into consideration while calculating current electricity tariffs.

An Electricity Contract Enforcement Authority will be formed for dispute resolution relating of contracts for sale and purchase of power. Along with it, the existing Appellate Tribunal of Electricity has been given powers similar to a civil court.\n\nTo improve the payment mechanism of states, the Bill has proposed that load despatch centres would be empowered to oversee the ‘Payment security mechanism’ before power is dispatched.

About 80 per cent of MFIs, which fall in the small and mid-sized category, don’t have investment grade rating and according to RBI, the funds availed under TLTRO 2.0 shall be deployed in investment grade instruments.

On the other hand, mutual funds will shy away from the sector as they are facing huge redemption pressure. Similarly, securitisaiton, which has been one of the major source of funding for NBFCs/HFCs during the last 18 months, could take a pause as collections remain uncertain during moratorium.\n\nAmidst these challenges, the liquidity measures taken by the RBI will definitely provide some solace but the sector continues to stare at asset side challenges which are expected to mount going forward after the moratorium period is over.", "keywords": ["bank", "moratorium", "dealing", "nbfcs", "cashflow", "sector", "promises", "liquidity", "issues", "banks", "rbi", "crore", "mfis", "rs", "support"], "summary": "These investments have to be made within one month of availing liquidity from the RBI.\n“We feel that the RBI would like the banks' to address the issue of moratorium rather than them giving directions to them.\nOf the total amount, NABARD will get Rs 25,000 crore for refinancing regional rural banks, co-operative banks and MFIs, Rs 15,000 crore will go to SIDBI.\nAs far as MFIs are concerned, while they have welcomed RBI’s announcements on liquidity support, medium and small sized MFIs are disappointed.\n“The demarcation of liquidity for small MFIs is encouraging but smaller ones might not get it as they don’t have investment grade rating.", "url": "https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/rbi-promises-liquidity-support-to-nbfcs-mfis-dealing-with-cashflow-issues-120041701259_1.html", "rss_link": "http://www.business-standard.com/rss/latest.rss", "title": "RBI promises liquidity support to NBFCs, MFIs dealing with cashflow issues"}, {"authors": ["Sukanya Roy"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "Money Heist is a Spanish television heist crime drama based on two perfect robberies in Spanish history led by the Professor (Álvaro Morte).

I would continue to eat better, I’d make sure I fit in my hour-long workout regardless of the fact that I have no equipment - I convinced myself that finding creative ways to stay fit would be an additional home-based adventure. And I would write, write, write until the cows came home to join me on lockdown too.\n\nHere’s how it’s all going so far: the healthy eating is staggered. In between getting in my green veggies and healthy proteins, I sneak in a piece of madeira cake or way too many marshmallow eggs. Weekends are when the sugar demon comes to visit and things really start to fall apart. I’m no baker but I’ve become quite the fritter fryer. Banana fritters, pumpkin fritters, honestly anything that can be fritted, I’ve fried. Workouts have morphed from once being the most exciting part of my day, to the most boring.\n\nFirst, I tried the regular isometric stuff I usually do. I filled a backpack with hardback books and used it as a weight. I substituted a step with a box of long life milk and to keep my heart rate up. I skipped. But the milk ran out, I kept choking the cat with the skipping rope, and I started to worry that my backpack would fall apart so I moved on to an old throwback favourite – Billy Blanks Taebo. I soon found myself doing more uppercuts than I could count, and while it’s great for a calorie burn it does little to make me feel like my muscles have actually worked.\n\nThe writing, well, that’s going a bit better. But like all writers know, there are down days and up days. Regardless of how much free time you have, sometimes the writing just doesn’t want to be writ. I’ve clocked about 13,000 words, I should be on three times that by now. So this week, I gave myself a break – or at least, that’s what I like to call it. A well deserved break. This is also known as diving head-first into a deep pool of procrastination and convincing myself that this was definitely a version of self-care and my mental health really, really needed to do absolutely nothing other than scroll endlessly on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter.\n\nSo my days now look a little like this, and I’m sure some of you can relate. I wake up a bit later than normal, because I sleep much later than I should – I have started to suffer from insomnia. I sit on my favourite chair with a cup of coffee and nurse it for so long that it turns into an ice cold cup of mud that I continue to sip on. I make sure my phone has a full charge and I spend about two hours trawling my timelines for content.\n\nAt first I became obsessed with keeping up with the orange man in North America. Watching his daft press conferences, trying to follow his drawl while desperately trying to figure out whether he was medically okay. Is something really, really wrong with him? Has he had the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV model thrown at him yet? I am certain something will come up. When the fret of \"first world's\" falling apart became too much for me, I switched over to trying out different free games from the app store. I really wish I had a PlayStation at this time, I do not but my favourite game to play at an arcade is Time Crisis, so I started playing a parallel sort of mobile version and an FPS (that’s \"first person shooter\" – I am so down with the gamer lingo now) game called Super Striker. I still play it, but my obsession with trying to crack down on the baddies and failing miserably has started to disturb the little REM sleep I get so now I do something different with the free time that I frankly shouldn’t have this much of. I laugh my way through lockdown. I laugh and laugh and laugh until my throat is wheezy and I sound like a cartoon dog. I laugh until my cat storms off and hides for the next three to four hours and I laugh until my wife can hear me through her noise cancelling earphones. She is very patient with me, but when I am teary with annoying incessant laughter she does tend to point daggers in my direction – in the kindest way possible.\n\nIt’s a great time for content creation and those who have mastered the art deserve a lot of recognition and praise for getting me, and I am sure, many of us, through this time. They’re not getting paid and in my opinion they really deserve to. They're fulfilling an essential service, even though it’s not written in any constitution. I’m not talking about the COVID-19 memes here or the endless covers of songs with the lyrics changed with terminology that’s pandemic related – those have had their time and that time has passed and now they’re really, really boring.\n\nI am talking about the comedians other content creators who release videos that are short and sweet and hilarious and have everything to do with our daily lives. They’re truly managing to tap into our new-normal, our current reality, and they’re doing it with organic talent.\n\nMy favourites include Waffles and Mo on Instagram – who always manage to transport me back to my childhood and my family who I stay far away from. Sherazaan Cummings is another favourite, she’s got a multitude of characters she portrays that she uses in skits that have me bent in half. Her latest one is about a Barbie doll and if you haven’t seen it, please do. And then, there’s my latest discovery: Amy Dirks. She's also on Twitter and Tik Tok.\n\nMost of these are in Kaaps, but they’re easy enough to understand if you don’t speak the language, and they provide a healthy does of culture-comedy.\n\nSo if you’re keen on laughing your way through lockdown in a comfy chair with a cup of ice-cold mud, please follow them. Run with scissors. Throw caution to the wind. Live on the edge. Listen to gangster rap. And support young talent.

He said the COVID-19 pandemic was exposing the lived experiences of communities in townships, villages, and suburbs which included the question of land.\n\n“This issue of the land has always been at the centre of the struggles of our people, the slogans of mayibuye iAfrika, izwe lethu [come back Africa, our land] is about land really. I think this disaster, the COVID-19 pandemic, really lays all of this bare for everyone to take notice,” Motlanthe said.\n\nMotlanthe led the high-level panel on the assessment of key legislation and the acceleration of fundamental change, which produced a report that warned that urbanisation should not be led by squatting or informal settlements.\n\n“We made it clear that it is not correct or proper to have urbanisation which is led by squatting or sprouting of informal settlements because land is finite. If you plan settlements properly you can utilise the space to absorb many people and still provide public spaces,” he said.\n\nThe former statesman further explained how this problem could be overcome.\n\n“A place like Johannesburg should be an example in terms of expropriation of land and do away with informal settlements altogether,” he said.\n\nMotlanthe also implored South Africans to support people who are forced to eke out a living in precarious conditions and sections of society most affected by poverty.\n\nWATCH: Lockdown: Minister Dlamini-Zuma explains amended regulations\n\nTRUMP AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER\n\nThis week, US President Donald Trump announced that the world’s superpower would halt financial contributions to the WHO for 60 to 90 days after accusing the world health body of being biased towards China and mishandling its initial response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMotlanthe told EWN that the suspension came as no surprise, but could cost the United States dearly.\n\nHe said the recent developments formed part of a greater shift of the global power base, which had been coming for some time. While the world struggles to come to terms with the devastating and life-altering impact of COVID-19, a transition towards a new world order could be in full swing too, according to Motlanthe.\n\nThe former president said as the US flexed its financial muscle to the international community, it could soon find itself toppled as the world’s power base.\n\n“I suspect that by withdrawing from all of these UN agencies and institutions and withdrawing active support, America is actually diminishing its own stature and leadership growth globally. We may actually be dealing with a transition where another economy will become the citadel of the new world order,” Motlanthe said.\n\nHe warned that if the dollar’s influence waned, this could be the dealbreaker for the US.\n\n“If the dollar remains the currency globally, it would postpone that kind of shift but all of this leads to even the dollar ceasing to be the currency globally, then the days of America as the citadel of this world will come to an end,” he said.\n\nMotlanthe further asserted that the US had not always been a superpower, tracing back history to the mercantilism system which cemented Holland as the economic stronghold of the world and later the British Empire.\n\nThe US and China have been struggling for power for a while now with the trade wars in recent years intensifying tensions.\n\nThe strain in relations was alighted by Trump’s aggression towards the Asian powerhouse over the spread of the COVID-19, which originated in that country.\n\nWATCH: COVID-19 Situation Desk - 16 April 2020 PM\n\nISOLATION: 'IT'S NOTHING AND IT'S DOABLE'\n\nAt the same time, Motlanthe encouraged South Africans not to despair over the nationwide lockdown regulations, saying those who were detained during apartheid had to endure even worse while fighting for freedom.\n\nWhile the former statesman acknowledged the plight of those who had to struggle for food among other essentials during this time, he said that for some, the isolation was “nothing”.\n\nMotlanthe likened the lockdown to when he and others were incommunicado for months under Section Six of the apartheid regime. The provision forced people involved in terrorism - freedom fighters in the main – to be detained for a 60-day period, which could be renewed without trial.\n\n“I think as South Africans we should really comply. Those of us who went through Section Six detention when we were held incommunicado for six months, this is a take-off, its nothing, and it is doable,” he said.\n\nSouth Africans were complaining of the strict lockdown regulations, which confined them to their homes and took away some of their comforts for the past 21 days.\n\nThe measures were implemented by government to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has claimed dozens of lives in South Africa already.\n\nFor official information about COVID-19 from the Department of Health, please click here.", "keywords": ["motlanthe", "africa", "isnt", "president", "lockdown", "fight", "budgets", "reprioritising", "covid19", "economy", "world", "pandemic", "south", "land", "exclusive"], "summary": "In a week-long series last week, EWN delved deeper into how spatial access in South Africa would set apart those who can and can’t isolate to prevent contracting the virus.\n'WE NEED NEW CAPITAL'As government scrambled to raise the necessary funds to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), Motlanthe said South Africa had reached a point where the reprioritisation of budgets would simply not work anymore.\nHe said the COVID-19 pandemic was exposing the lived experiences of communities in townships, villages, and suburbs which included the question of land.\nI think this disaster, the COVID-19 pandemic, really lays all of this bare for everyone to take notice,” Motlanthe said.\nThe measures were implemented by government to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has claimed dozens of lives in South Africa already.", "url": "https://ewn.co.za/2020/04/17/motlanthe-covid-19-pandemic-is-exposing-lived-experiences-of-s-africans", "rss_link": "http://ewn.co.za/RSS%2520Feeds/Latest%2520News?category=Local", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Reprioritising budgets isn't enough to fight COVID-19"}, {"authors": ["Veronica Mokhoali", "Cooperative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma At A Briefing On The Coronavirus In Pretoria On March Picture", "Presidencyza Twitter", "One Day Ago", "Minutes Ago", "One Hour Ago", "Hours Ago"], "publish_date": "04/16/2020, 00:00:00", "text": "Govt's COVID-19 national command council to brief SA on lockdown extension\n\nThe lockdown is expected to end on 30 April, while mass testings take place around the country, treatment is offered to those that need it and awareness campaigns are ramped up.\n\nJOHANNESBURG -

The crisis is already hitting major social and economic systems, yet black Americans will experience a disproportionate share of the disruption—from morbidity and mortality to unemployment and bankruptcy.\n\nMcKinsey analysis shows that black Americans are almost twice as likely to live in the counties at highest risk of health and economic disruption, if or when the pandemic hits those counties. To assess disruption, we evaluated five indicators: underlying health conditions, poverty rate, number of hospital beds, percentage of people in severe housing conditions, and population density. This integrated health and economic perspective describes which counties are likely to take a “one-two punch” due to the pandemic and could get trapped in a vicious cycle of economic instability and poor health.\n\nIn addition, we found that 39 percent of all jobs held by black Americans—compared with 34 percent held by white Americans—are now threatened by reductions in hours or pay, temporary furloughs, or permanent layoffs, totaling 7 million jobs.\n\nIndeed, the pandemic underscores the consequences of the structural disparities that have persisted in this country for centuries while presenting an opportunity to invest in building more equitable systems that will benefit society overall. In this article, we outline some of the key findings from our report on COVID-19 and black America.\n\nPlaces at highest risk\n\nBecause the situation continues to evolve, projections are necessarily, at best, probabilistic. Even so, our analysis suggests that black Americans are 1.4–1.8 times as likely to live in counties at highest risk of disruption from the pandemic (exhibit). Thirty percent of the country’s population lives in these high-risk counties, compared with 43 percent (17.6 million) of black Americans. The counties in the highest-risk decile are home to only 10 percent of the US population as a whole—but to 18 percent of the black population.\n\nExhibit We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nRisks to health and lives\n\nNationally, black Americans are not only more likely to be at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 but also have lower access to testing. In addition, they are likely to experience more severe complications from the infection; black Americans are on average about 30 percent likelier to have health conditions that exacerbate the effects of COVID-19.\n\nUnfortunately, black Americans are overrepresented in nine of the ten lowest-paid, high-contact essential services, which elevates their risk of contracting the virus. Thirty-three percent of nursing assistants, 39 percent of orderlies, and 39 percent of psychiatric aides, are black. Black workers are putting their lives and health on the line to provide goods and services that matter to our society.\n\nAlthough little testing data are available, as of April 4, ten of the 16 states where 65 percent of black Americans live were below the median testing rate for the country as a whole. Black Americans were already twice as likely as their white peers to die from diabetes, hypertension, and asthma—all risk factors that exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms. Even black Americans who do not need care for COVID-19 are likelier than white Americans to suffer from the pandemic’s secondary effects on our overloaded medical system, including delayed—but necessary—medical procedures.\n\nRisks to livelihoods and economic futures\n\nAs the impact of the pandemic moves from health to economic consequences, black Americans will likely sustain more damage across every stage of the wealth-building journey. Crucially, 39 percent of jobs held by black workers (seven million jobs in all) are vulnerable as a result of the COVID-19 crisis compared with 34 percent for white workers. Forty percent of the revenues of black-owned businesses are located in the five most vulnerable sectors—including leisure, hospitality, and retail—compared with 25 percent of the revenues of all US businesses. Forty-eight percent of black survey respondents report regularly using food-assistance programs, compared with 31 percent of white respondents. Such services are likely to come under significant strain and interruptions as a result of the pandemic.\n\nProtective measures\n\nThere is an immediate opportunity to protect black Americans and their communities from the worst effects of the COVID-19 crisis. These interventions should target the places where black people live, work, and do business.\n\nTo identify and mitigate disparities, it will be critical to track the damage and the recovery from the pandemic along racial lines. Relevant information includes (but is not limited to) rates of infection, access to healthcare providers and testing, jobs lost, and small business loans allocated. In addition, stakeholders could also identify and patch gaps in services normally provided by the public education system and increase resources for the most affected students and families.\n\nTraining and deploying community health workers, which are common in places where the need for healthcare significantly outstrips supply, could increase access to health services. Community health workers help connect patients to both health and social services, build trust in healthcare systems, and reserve capacity for licensed healthcare workers to treat the most critical cases. Community and faith-based organizations can use their roles as hubs to organize the workers, share information about the virus, encourage preventive measures such as environmental and personal hygiene and physical distancing, and distribute personal protective equipment (PPE) and sanitary equipment to the homes of essential workers. These organizations can also provide targeted, wraparound support to people with high-risk comorbidities.\n\nBlack workers are putting their lives and health on the line to provide goods and services that matter to our society.\n\nStakeholders could deliberately support the most vulnerable workers, including black Americans. Some employers are finding creative solutions that keep people employed, and this could be supplemented with job-matching and reskilling programs that can efficiently redeploy talent even during a macroeconomic contraction. Employers could also maintain a commitment to equity when they downsize. Support programs that provide direct and in-kind forms of liquidity (such as straightforward cash assistance, short-term extensions for financial obligations, and loan and interest forgiveness) could help sustain families in financial distress.\n\nCommunity development financial institutions (CDFIs), churches, and nonprofits could help black-owned businesses and residents to access recovery funds. Similarly, new financial products and programs such as community rainy-day funds could fortify the resilience of communities. Corporations could make a point to work with black-owned businesses.\n\nRecovery, rebuilding, and reimagination\n\nCOVID-19’s outsized impact on the black community reflects public health and socioeconomic disparities that have long been intertwined. The pandemic is an opportunity to invest in addressing structural challenges to help black Americans recover and to build and sustain more equitable communities.\n\nInvestments in public health, digital infrastructure, institutions of public education, and economic development planning should continue long after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. In particular, stakeholders could consider setting national goals to improve health equity and create plans to meet those goals.\n\nSupport for black homeowners and businesses could be a priority to ensure that black families do not lose their assets and resources. That kind of support could include protection from bankruptcy, insolvency, and eviction, all of which will disproportionately affect black Americans as part of the pandemic’s fallout. Institutions could also support equity in compensation and career progression. These types of assistance speak less to protection and more to providing the opportunities and stability required to help black families build a resilient economic foundation.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is already a generation-defining crisis. Because it affects all social systems, it heightens preexisting structural challenges that black Americans face. But a trial can also be an opportunity. Our society can consider how we can respond to the COVID-19 crisis and fallout to fortify black communities and help them do more than simply recover. We can use the urgency of the pandemic to build more equitable systems that increase the long-term resilience of black Americans, communities, and institutions. As we progress toward this goal, the US economy could benefit to the tune of $1.5 trillion.", "keywords": ["covid19", "americans", "help", "livelihoods", "pandemic", "workers", "likely", "services", "black", "investing", "lives", "health", "economic"], "summary": "Thirty percent of the country’s population lives in these high-risk counties, compared with 43 percent (17.6 million) of black Americans.\nBlack workers are putting their lives and health on the line to provide goods and services that matter to our society.\nProtective measuresThere is an immediate opportunity to protect black Americans and their communities from the worst effects of the COVID-19 crisis.\nBlack workers are putting their lives and health on the line to provide goods and services that matter to our society.\nBecause it affects all social systems, it heightens preexisting structural challenges that black Americans face.", "url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/covid-19-investing-in-black-lives-and-livelihoods", "rss_link": "http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/rss.aspx", "title": "COVID-19: Investing in black lives and livelihoods"}, {"authors": ["Ari Chester", "Sylvain Johansson", "Steven Kauderer", "Erwann Michel-Kerjan", "Andy Pinkes", "About The Author S", "Ari Chester Is A Partner In Mckinsey S Pittsburgh Office", "Sylvain Johansson Is A Senior Partner In The Geneva Office", "Steven Kauderer Is A Senior Partner In The New York Office", "Erwann Michel-Kerjan Is A Partner In The Philadelphia Office"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "Downloadable Resources Open interactive popup\n\nThe rapid evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak makes it difficult to predict the full effect of its tragic human, economic, and geopolitical consequences with certainty. The global insurance industry is intertwined with a broad spectrum of economic activities, so the pandemic is likely to affect the property and casualty (P&C) insurance operating model as we know it today on several fronts. In addition to presenting immediate and considerable operational challenges, the pandemic will hinder mid- and longer-term growth and profitability. It also reinforces the urgency of accelerating product innovation and digital transformation—efforts that were already underway at many companies—to help the industry more effectively serve customer needs in this changing environment.\n\nIn this article, we outline the unprecedented challenges brought by COVID-19; offer a perspective on the forecast for commercial, specialty, and personal lines, including business interruption coverage; and outline priorities for P&C insurers to consider as they navigate the crisis.\n\nUnprecedented challenges\n\nWe expect both the short-term and long-term behavioral and economic impact of the crisis to have diverse implications for the various P&C lines, which in aggregate will challenge the economics of the industry. Across segments, carriers that are unable to reduce costs in line with reductions in premiums will see expense ratios deteriorate. Some lines within P&C may face the prospect of higher-than-anticipated loss experiences.\n\nAbove all, insurance companies will confront the same business-continuity and operational challenges faced by all industries. Indeed, every facet of P&C operations will be affected—from frontline sales, to underwriting, to back-end policy administration, to claims management. While some carriers and agents have made progress in automation and digital engagement, the industry generally remains reliant on manual processing and face-to-face interaction. Remote-working environments may stretch technology bandwidth, impede capability building and collaboration, and decrease the workforce’s productivity. New business in most segments will be lower during the crisis. And the likelihood of second-order challenges, such as fraud and early policy cancellation, will be heightened.\n\nShort- and long-term challenges\n\nThe most immediate impact on insurance companies is the risk incurred by many employees’ sudden shift to remote working. Some functions, such as claims adjusting, typically require employee presence in the field. Most carriers do not yet have the digital tools and platforms to enable those employees to work entirely remotely. Even those who technically can work fully remote may struggle to adjust to this new way of working, especially at first. Remote working tends to inhibit cross-functional collaboration—which is particularly crucial for the claims, underwriting, and actuarial functions. It can also make decision making more inconsistent on multiple levels—from executives steering the portfolio to the frontline workers making claims and underwriting choices, resulting in higher leakage and potentially poor results.\n\nLow interest rates will cause many P&C insurers to face decreased normalized earnings. If rates remain low, particularly in the long term, this would add another challenge for P&C players. Prolonged low rates would disproportionately affect the economics of longer-tail lines of business, and some lines will risk becoming uneconomical to write. In the near term, market contraction will lead to drawdowns in the portfolio, particularly for equities.\n\nThere will also be repercussions for growth. P&C insurance growth depends on both exposure (economic units) and rate cycle (insurance pricing), so growth is possible even in times of economic decline as long as pricing is improving. In the United States, the P&C industry’s growth during the 2001–02 recession remained mostly solid (Exhibit 1). The industry performed relatively steadily through the Great Recession as well, though it is clear that commercial insurance is more vulnerable to economic conditions compared with personal insurance.\n\nExhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nImpact on commercial and specialty lines\n\nAt a more granular level, the impact on commercial lines will vary by type of coverage (Exhibit 2).\n\nExhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nCore lines: Volume decline\n\nAcross core property and liability coverages, most of the direct effects will be felt by lines that are priced based on payroll or company revenue, as well as other exposure units that directly decrease with economic contraction. For instance, as unemployment rises, payroll will decrease—reducing the need for workers’ compensation products in countries that offer it, including Australia and the United States. In many cases, this impact will be felt as soon as the second quarter of 2020 as premium adjustments reflect lower staffing levels.\n\nProperty premiums may decline as customers cut costs by consolidating assets and inventory into fewer buildings. Within liability lines, the pandemic brings a higher risk of allegations that policyholders have failed to provide adequate protection (for example, masks, hand sanitizer, cleanliness, hazard warnings, and proper physical-distancing protocols). Across both property and liability, the small commercial segment will be hit the hardest, as small businesses are typically the most sensitive to economic conditions. Small businesses account for about one-third of global commercial markets, on average. Depending on the length and severity of the economic constriction, this segment will be heavily distressed as small companies struggle to sustain their activity (and many will go out of business) alongside a slowdown in new business formation.\n\nProfessional liability lines: Increased demand, potential increase in litigation\n\nSeveral professional liability lines may see more claims activity. Cyber insurance will face increased losses given the heightened vulnerability introduced by an expanded remote workforce—for example, employees who may or may not connect through approved virtual private networks. Security standards in a home-office environment are generally less robust than the typical office environment, and cybersecurity experts have described an uptick in cyberattacks (including phishing and network attacks) taking advantage of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nDirectors and officers insurance often sees increased claims activity when the economy moves into a recession. Additionally, specific to this pandemic, shareholders may contend that management was negligent in foreseeing and handling COVID-19 risk. Allegations could include failing to develop adequate contingency plans, not observing the protocols recommended by authorities, and not properly disclosing the risks the pandemic poses to the company’s performance, among others.\n\nHealthcare professional liability and medical malpractice is another clear area of concern. The heightened exposure of medical personnel to COVID-19 could result in elevated claims activity.\n\nSpecialty lines: Slowdown until global trade recovers\n\nCertain specialty markets, such as aviation, marine, and construction, will be affected by reductions in global travel, trade, and new builds during the crisis. They may benefit from reduced loss exposure in the immediate future (as the use of underlying assets has rapidly reduced) but will struggle to reach pre-crisis levels of activity until global trade activity fully resumes.\n\nCredit and surety loss ratios will also suffer as the crisis leads to halts in economic activity and more companies experience financial distress. During previous recessions, surety typically saw higher loss ratios in adverse economic conditions, as projects became more difficult to complete and contractors’ capital positions were impaired.\n\nEvent cancellation is a relatively small line globally but will be among the hardest hit. Many events around the world planned in the second and third quarters of 2020 are being canceled or delayed given the imperative of physical distancing to slow the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak and to prevent overloading the healthcare system. The unprecedented number of concurrent cancellations will most certainly result in significant claims exposure. For instance, leading reinsurers have publicly communicated that their exposures to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which have been delayed until 2021, could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nBusiness interruption coverage: Are pandemics covered?\n\nAnother potential exposure for insurance companies comes from business interruption coverage, which is typically included in property policies and indemnifies companies for loss of profits if the business is shut down for reasons specified in the contract. Typical all-risk commercial property policies insure against direct physical loss or damage to covered property resulting from any nonexcluded risk.\n\nGenerally, diseases such as COVID-19 are excluded as an insured peril (unless added by endorsement). Most policies exclude losses from viruses, bacteria, or other contaminants, which are usually not viewed as causing physical loss. However, there will be challenges and litigation addressing whether COVID-19 has caused direct physical loss at insured locations. In the United States, case law differs by jurisdiction. Some courts have held that contamination by semitangible biological or chemical agents can constitute direct physical loss if the contamination impairs the function of the property, making it unusable for its intended function. In these cases, the presence of COVID-19 could be considered a direct physical loss. However, in other jurisdictions, there is a high bar to confirm the presence of a physical contaminant, and courts will be reluctant to view COVID-19 as the cause of direct physical loss.\n\nMany traditional property insurance policies include civil authority coverage, which addresses loss of income due to government shutdowns that cause an inability to access insured premises. However, triggering this coverage also requires civil authority action to be attributed to direct physical loss. Currently many businesses are shut down as part of voluntary or government-mandated efforts to shelter in place and prevent the spread of contamination, not because of actual contamination. Policy wording would suggest there is no direct physical loss without actual physical contamination or a direct shutdown of adjacent property, and therefore coverage would not apply.\n\nRegulators across several states have issued bulletins clarifying that pandemics are generally excluded. The Maryland Insurance Administration likened COVID-19 to nuclear war, which is an excluded loss under typical insurance policies, since “potential loss costs from such perils are so extreme that providing coverage would jeopardize the financial solvency of property insurers.” However, we are starting to see pressure from legislative bodies to take a more expansive view of coverage. For instance, a March 18 bipartisan statement by 18 members of the US Congress urged insurers to “recognize financial loss due to COVID-19 as part of policyholders’ business interruption coverage.” Similarly, legislation is being introduced in some states (as of this writing, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio) to compel insurers to cover business interruption claims attributed to COVID-19. The UK Parliament has raised similar questions. The outcomes remain unclear. Even if legislation is successfully passed, this issue will be heavily litigated, raising constitutional-law issues.\n\nCOVID-19’s impact on business interruption coverage remains highly uncertain—but it clearly represents a reputation risk for P&C insurers, and finding the right balance and approach across all stakeholders will be challenging. After the 2020 policy year resolves, the industry will look to innovate and explore the potential for expanded pandemic-related coverage. Some such products were introduced to the market before the current crisis. For example, the World Bank Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility has various instruments that will trigger based on a predefined number of deaths. Additionally, in private markets, Marsh, Munich Re, and Metabiota introduced a pandemic risk solution using a “pathogenic sentiment index” that triggers under certain thresholds during an epidemic or pandemic. These products, prior to the current crisis, had low adoption. Indeed, pandemic business interruption protection has proven to be a coverage need that was imagined but not appreciated until very recently.\n\nImpact on personal lines\n\nAs we’ve seen in previous recessions, personal lines carriers are less vulnerable than commercial lines carriers to disruption due to COVID-19. But again, the effects will vary by coverage type (Exhibit 3).\n\nExhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

New auto policies will slow down as new car purchases decline, while insurance agents may find new business production challenging in a remote environment. In the United States, some carriers are starting to return premiums to customers proactively, reflecting decreased usage. However, with fewer miles driven and fewer cars on the road, frequency rates should decrease considerably, improving loss ratios in the near term.\n\nAs with business interruption coverage, personal auto coverage may also be subject to regulatory action. In the United States, the state of Colorado’s insurance department has asked insurance companies to temporarily remove the delivery service exclusion, which is common in auto insurance policies, to help restaurants and other services expand delivery while they remain closed to in-person customers.\n\nHome: Stable\n\nAs individuals and families spend more time in their homes, homeowner’s insurance coverage will not be affected. McKinsey analysis has shown that personal property insurance levels remain resilient even in times of economic contraction and depressed property values. However, if a large, catastrophic event were to occur, such as an earthquake or heavy flooding, the emergency management response would be more challenging than usual given the extended time required to complete reconstruction while honoring physical distancing requirements.\n\nWould you like to learn more about our Financial Services Practice\n\nNiche lines: Travel hit hard, rise in contextual sales coverage\n\nSeveral of the smaller niche lines will also feel the effects of COVID-19. For instance, travel insurance is likely the hardest hit line in the short term, as existing in-force policies are experiencing a tidal wave of claims. Pandemics are often excluded from coverage, particularly since previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2002. However, some leading companies have made an exception and are waiving this exclusion for those with COVID-19.\n\nContextual insurance is an emerging product category, particularly in Asia, that protects products purchased online and delivered to a home or business. Adoption of these products outside of Asia has been low, but with the increased shift to online transactions as people work and shop remotely, there could be increased adoption of these coverages in mature markets.\n\nPositioning your organization to navigate this crisis\n\nNavigating these challenges—and repositioning the organization for when the crisis subsides—requires a comprehensive response beyond near-term business-continuity measures. On a positive note, several senior executives, in recent discussions with McKinsey, have mentioned that their organizations have been surprisingly resilient in adapting to current conditions.\n\nAs companies continue to navigate this crisis, priority actions include the following:\n\nBuild remote-working models. For carriers with significant manual, high-value processes (for example, underwriting and claims), it will be critical to maintain oversight, coaching, and collaboration in remote-working environments. This could include establishing virtual dashboards to monitor progress, launching remote team huddles via video conference, and ensuring managers are still coaching and leading their teams despite logistical challenges. It is equally important to prioritize employee morale and both physical and mental health during these turbulent times. In addition, it will be important to roll out performance incentives to ensure world-class decisions and actions that align with a remote-working environment.\n\nOvercommunicate with stakeholders. Acting fast is critical in the current environment. Executives will want to regularly communicate with the board, investors, regulators, and other key stakeholders to promote clarity and syndication regarding the decisions made and actions taken.\n\nStress-test and develop granular strategies for the portfolio. As discussed above, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be pervasive, however it will have varying impact across segments and coverage types. Comprehensive stress testing will be essential for carriers to rapidly assess exposure across sectors, understand the financial impact, and develop segment-specific responses to meet the needs of customers, agents, and the business. Scenario testing will require organizing a multidisciplinary team across underwriting, claims, actuarial, and risk to anticipate the impact. From a practical perspective, building COVID-19 claims coding into current systems will be crucial to documenting and understanding the pandemic’s immediate impact.\n\nInnovate the product portfolio. In the very near term, existing products may need to be repriced (for example, commercial auto policies with decreasing exposure units) and coverage will need to be clarified (for example, whether business interruption includes pandemic-related shutdowns). Over the longer term, this crisis highlights the importance of launching new product offerings (for example, flexible delivery-services coverage for restaurants) and accelerating usage-based offerings (for example, output-based coverage for manufacturing or telematics for auto). In the longer term, the industry will explore expanding business-continuity coverage to directly cover pandemic exposure.\n\nConsider government partnerships for risk management. Pandemics, because they affect so many people and businesses at the same time, are typically considered uninsurable. Insurers and governments could collaborate further on financial protection against this risk. As an analogue, in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, terrorism risk was viewed as uninsurable by private insurance markets. Since then, many countries around the world have established national insurance programs as partnerships between the insurance industry and the national government to make this risk insurable, particularly for terrorism and natural catastrophe exposures. Similar structures might be explored for pandemic risk.\n\nGain a deeper understanding of future risk. For coverages that require promotion of safety standards, such as workers’ compensation and professional liability, insurance companies will need to update the risk management guidance provided to customers, encouraging them to appropriately plan for pandemic-related risk that may emerge in the future. Customers look to insurance companies to provide guidance on how to best prevent or mitigate future losses.\n\nInvest in distribution agents. Many agents are small business owners themselves, struggling to adjust to remote working models and maintain their own economic activity. Doubling down on partnerships with agents during this time of need will be critical to supporting their operations and building deeper loyalty and trust. This could include expanding offerings from central service centers, providing white-labeled digital interfaces to enable online sales by agents, and providing webinars and training to agents (and customers) on how to navigate the “new normal” of COVID-19 working conditions. Some carriers are also providing short-term cash flow relief to help mitigate the slowdown in new business sales.\n\nAccelerate automation and digital transformation. If ever there was a time when intermediaries and policyholders might be willing to abandon paper and move online, that time is now. This opportunity can represent the tipping point. Carriers can lean in by promoting digital channels for all segments of the value chain, from equipping agents with remote capabilities to driving distinctive customer engagement through digital payments, submissions, and claims. It is also important to acquire and develop the appropriate technical skills to interact with customers on their terms and to meet their evolving needs.\n\nSupport customers. The industry has an opportunity to align premium collection with underlying asset usage—for instance, if personal automobiles have lower utilization, insurance companies may return premiums or temporarily reduce rates. Similar concessions may be made for individuals or businesses facing immediate financial duress from the shutdown of economic activity.\n\nIn this time of crisis, P&C carriers should focus on their employees, their customers, and their business—in that order. Insurance companies provide crucial stability to the economy and to their customers both personally and professionally. They provide value through the promise to pay future claims, so the industry must calibrate its pricing and coverage to ensure its viability in light of this crisis. More than ever, this is also a time for insurance companies to provide customers with the empathy and support they need.", "keywords": ["coverage", "coronavirus", "insurers", "pc", "response", "insurance", "longterm", "business", "loss", "lines", "risk", "actions", "short", "covid19", "claims", "companies", "economic"], "summary": "Above all, insurance companies will confront the same business-continuity and operational challenges faced by all industries.\nShort- and long-term challengesThe most immediate impact on insurance companies is the risk incurred by many employees’ sudden shift to remote working.\nAdditionally, specific to this pandemic, shareholders may contend that management was negligent in foreseeing and handling COVID-19 risk.\nHome: StableAs individuals and families spend more time in their homes, homeowner’s insurance coverage will not be affected.\nMore than ever, this is also a time for insurance companies to provide customers with the empathy and support they need.", "url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/coronavirus-response-short-and-long-term-actions-for-p-and-c-insurers", "rss_link": "http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/rss.aspx", "title": "Coronavirus response: Short- and long-term actions for P&C insurers"}, {"authors": ["David Fine", "Julia Klier", "Deepa Mahajan", "Nico Raabe", "Jörg Schubert", "Navjot Singh", "Seckin Ungur", "About The Author S", "David Fine Is A Senior Partner In Mckinsey S London Office", "Julia Klier Is A Partner In The Munich Office"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "Downloadable Resources Open interactive popup\n\nCOVID-19 is the most serious health crisis the world has experienced in a century—and it could also be one of the biggest destroyers of jobs in human history. That matters greatly: when people are stripped of their work, they suffer losses not just of income but also of dignity, meaning, and hope.\n\nThe International Labour Organization has forecast that the pandemic could reduce global working hours by nearly 7 percent in the second quarter of 2020—equivalent to 195 million full-time jobs. McKinsey’s analysis suggests that, in regions as diverse as Africa, Europe, and the United States, up to a third of the workforce is vulnerable to reduced income, furloughs, or layoffs as a result of the crisis. Many millions of jobs could be lost permanently. That, in turn, would greatly dampen consumer spending, with knock-on effects across economies.\n\nEven in countries in which laid-off workers receive protection through unemployment insurance or wage subsidies, there will be many informal workers who fall through the safety net—and the social and psychological toll of joblessness will be widely felt. Indeed, there is a serious danger that the loss of work will disproportionately affect those who can least afford it, including lower-wage earners and small enterprises.\n\nLeaders in the public, private, and social sectors are already taking urgent steps to manage the fast-evolving crisis of jobs and work. But we believe there is room—and need—for greater focus, speed, boldness, and innovation in this effort. Our worldwide research on emerging strategies and best practices suggests that governments and their partners need to take urgent action in the following two key areas:\n\nCreate a granular view of who needs help to keep their job—or find new work. Countries, regions, and cities can quickly develop a granular view of where jobs are at risk and where there is additional demand for labor—by sector, occupation, demographics, and geography. That view needs to put special focus on small businesses and the most vulnerable workers, including those in the gig economy and the informal sector. Build smart, cross-sector solutions to get that help to them fast. As governments prepare to reopen economies postlockdown, they need to find smart ways to maximize employment and protect against new infections, following global guidelines and those of their local public-health agencies. Again, special focus will be needed on restarting and supporting small businesses, which account for the majority of jobs in most countries. At the same time, governments and businesses will need to create new mechanisms to help people whose jobs are at risk redeploy into occupations in which labor demand still outstrips supply—and rapidly build the skills needed for their new roles.\n\nCreating a granular view of who needs help to keep their job—or find new work\n\nMany countries have already taken decisive actions to safeguard jobs. Such actions include implementing wage subsidies, allowing freelancers and sole traders to claim unemployment benefits without shutting down their businesses, and supporting working-from-home policies through tax incentives or transfers.\n\nTo deepen the effectiveness of such efforts and to open up new job opportunities, governments and other key institutions can quickly create a more granular picture of where jobs are at risk and where there is additional demand for labor. We suggest that this picture should demarcate the extent of the challenge on three key dimensions: industry sector and occupation, demographics (such as income, education level, and age), and enterprise size.\n\nWhich industry sectors and occupations are most at risk?\n\nIn recent days, our colleagues have published analyses showing the number of jobs at risk by sector and occupation in key regions of the world, as lockdowns and physical-distancing measures shutter large parts of the economy. In Europe and the United States, just two service industries (accommodation and food services plus wholesale and retail) account for around 40 percent of all vulnerable jobs. Among occupations, more than 80 percent of customer-service and sales roles are at risk.\n\nBuilding on these broad views of the sectors and occupations at risk, governments can develop a granular view of the jobs that are vulnerable, both by industry and service and by occupation. Each occupation can be assessed according to the level of disease exposure inherent in the role and the degree of demand shock that the occupation has experienced during the crisis. This assessment can also consider where demand for labor has increased. For example, our analysis of the Australian labor market shows that, during the crisis, there have been significant new job opportunities in the grocery, call-center, and information- and communication-technology (ICT) sectors.\n\nBuilding on these broad views of the sectors and occupations at risk, governments can develop a granular view of the jobs that are vulnerable, both by industry and service and by occupation.\n\nA heat map can be created at the level of an entire country, a region, a city, or a suburb. The result would provide governments and their private-sector partners with an initial list of the businesses and services in which jobs could be lost—and are therefore in need of interventions to safeguard employment—as well as those in which jobs are being created. In Australia, for example, we have developed heat maps at both the national and state levels, and it is possible to refine that further to individual postcode (Exhibit 1). Their value lies in tracking where opportunities for redeployment may exist. The heat maps would need to be updated regularly to capture the dynamic nature of the labor market, given the evolution of the pandemic and governments’ responses to it.\n\nExhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nWhich demographics are most vulnerable?\n\nDecision makers need to be keenly aware of the danger that the loss of work will disproportionately affect those who can least afford it, including lower-wage earners. For example, McKinsey’s analysis in the United States has found that lockdowns disproportionally affect low-income workers. People who were living paycheck to paycheck do not have the financial cushion to absorb a shock of this magnitude (Exhibit 2).\n\nExhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nIn Europe, our analysis finds that education has a significant impact on the level of short-term job risk, potentially exacerbating existing social cleavages. Four-fifths of the total jobs at risk in Europe are positions that do not require a tertiary degree, while employees without a tertiary degree are almost twice as likely to have their job at risk than are employees with a university education. Our research in Europe also finds that the jobs of young workers—those aged 24 and younger—are at significantly higher risk in the crisis.\n\nCountries in every region and at every development stage need to ensure that similar analysis is undertaken so that they can identify the most vulnerable groups—and target interventions to safeguard the employment of those groups. Interventions may include ramping up existing programs to support vulnerable groups. In Brazil, for example, 3.1 billion reais (approximately $610 million) has been provided to the Bolsa Família, a government program introduced in 2003 to support Brazilian families living in poverty, enabling it to reach an additional one million people directly affected by the COVID-19 impact on the economy. Another intervention example is the Canada Emergency Response Benefit that aims to provide a taxable benefit of 2,000 Canadian dollars (approximately $1,440) a month for up to four months to support workers who are facing unemployment and are not eligible for employment insurance.\n\nBeyond income level, education level, and age group, countries might also need to consider the particular risks to the jobs of minority and female workers. In emerging economies, in particular, special attention will need to be paid to informal-sector workers, who make up a large share of the total workforce and are particularly vulnerable.\n\nHow will small enterprises be affected?\n\nSpecial focus will also be needed on small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), which account for the majority of jobs in most economies, and many of whose viability is more likely to be put at risk by the crisis. McKinsey’s analysis in Australia, for example, has found that SMEs account for 68 percent of all jobs at risk across the economy—and nearly 80 percent of jobs in accommodation and food services, one of the hardest hit sectors. And a recent McKinsey survey of SMEs in the United States found that half of all companies in the study had already laid off or furloughed employees (Exhibit 3). Those who are self-employed or part of the gig economy are also seeing precipitous drops in their incomes.\n\nExhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nThis is an even greater consideration in developing economies. In Africa, for example, SMEs account for 80 percent of employment, compared with 50 percent in the European Union and 60 percent in the United States. Compounding this, many small businesses in emerging markets operate in the informal sector, making it critical that economic-revitalization efforts extend to informal parts of the economy.\n\nSmaller businesses, including those in the informal sector, typically have smaller balance sheets than do their larger counterparts. In the United States, for example, the median small business has a cash buffer that will last only 27 days, while one-quarter of SMEs surveyed hold a cash buffer that will last only 13 days or fewer. Some SMEs are highly dependent on a few large B2B customers, while many such enterprises operate in hard-hit sectors, such as tourism and retail. Another challenge among informal enterprises and gig-economy workers is that they are typically not registered with government and regulatory agencies, making it difficult to ensure that help will reach them. Compounding the issue further, small businesses often have a disproportionately large share of the economy in rural areas.\n\nAll of that makes it essential that governments and larger businesses understand the extent to which SMEs—and the people they employ—are vulnerable to losing their work.\n\nBuilding smart solutions to help people get back to work\n\nGovernments around the world, along with private and social sectors, are redoubling their efforts to suppress COVID-19 and save lives. While the battle is far from over, there are indications that an increasing number of countries are succeeding in slowing or reversing the growth rate of infections. These countries can prepare to transition to a new phase in which physical-lockdown restrictions are carefully modified while test, trace, and track strategies remain firmly in place.\n\nSafeguarding and recreating jobs must be critical priorities as countries, regions, and cities enter this transition. A sector- and occupation-level heat map can be a key tool in this effort: for each at-risk industry or service, governments and their partners can shape bold, rapid interventions to increase business activity and recreate jobs.\n\nOne key focus of these interventions must be to stimulate consumer demand and rebuild confidence—and lessons on those topics can be learned from previous crises. For example, several countries that experienced sharp drops in tourism in the wake of terror attacks focused on rebuilding local confidence and demand before addressing global markets. A crucial tool was to offer vouchers or discounts for targeted customer groups.\n\nWe should note that many countries do not have the luxury of throwing money at the challenge of rekindling their economies, as they face serious fiscal and liquidity constraints. In these countries, solutions will require considerable creativity—and potentially the involvement of the private sector. In South Africa, for example, businesspeople quickly established the South African Future Trust to offer an initial 1 billion South African rands (approximately $55 million) in support to SMEs affected by the pandemic. It received more than 10,000 applications in the first few days after launch on April 3, 2020, and has partnered with the country’s largest banks to process applications and make payments directly to SME employees. At the same time, governments and businesses will need to create new mechanisms to help those people whose jobs are at risk redeploy into occupations for which labor demand still exists.\n\nThese initiatives will require unprecedented speed and agility—and extraordinary degrees of collaboration. To make that possible, governments may need to enable companies to cooperate to keep people employed, engage in joint training programs, and work together to support the small businesses in their supply chains.\n\nSafeguarding and recreating jobs through targeted redeployment and reskilling\n\nEven before the COVID-19 crisis, structural shifts—for example, the adoption of automation and the move toward clean energy—that were reshaping the labor market and increasing demand for particular skills were under way. Technological advances were expected to bring large-scale change in demand for particular roles in the workforce. For example, demand was forecast to increase for ICT specialists and managers as well as for “future skills,” such as digital literacy and cognitive, social, and emotional skills. Demand was expected to decline for administrative roles.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis ushers in a new paradigm for reskilling across three dimensions. First, physical distancing causes traditional formats to be replaced online, calling for creativity in delivering effective training (specifically for soft skills, such as teamwork). Second, rapid reskilling requires much shorter interventions and a different system to recognize those skills. Microcredits will replace traditional degrees in many cases. Third, a crisis of this degree calls for a mindset shift toward the greater good of society as opposed to focusing on competitive advantage for a specific company. Companies that otherwise would be business competitors will need to collaborate and provide reskilling opportunities at an industry level.\n\nWe propose the following three key ideas for action:\n\nRapidly build online “talent exchanges” to create transparency on job openings and facilitate redeployment. There is an urgent need for transparency on changing demand, growing job opportunities, and information on existing skills that may be underutilized and for better, faster matching between job seekers and employers. Industry associations, labor agencies, and groups of large companies can quickly create exchanges or portals on which employers can post new openings and displaced workers, backed by their existing companies, can find redeployment and secondment opportunities. For example, a group of companies in the US food sector created an exchange in just six days, launching it in early April 2020. Governments and not-for-profit organizations can complement online exchanges with support services for displaced workers, such as coaching, counseling, and helping polish résumés. Granted, there would be tremendous challenges in bringing talent exchanges to the scale required, but the COVID-19 crisis creates unprecedented urgency for public and private sectors to ramp up their efforts in this arena.\n\nReskill at speed and scale. Governments, business associations, and educational institutions should be asking themselves, “How do we use the downturn to retrain and future-proof our workforce?” The temporary decline of some industries also provides an opportunity for upskilling toward future-skill-growth areas. Two discrete interventions are needed in this regard: rapid upskilling for short-term demand surges, such as in grocery retail, and longer-term upskilling or reskilling that enables individuals to move into careers aligned with future-skill trends, such as health services. Longer-term interventions could also focus on digital literacy and social and emotional skills—the building blocks that workers need to stay relevant in a more dynamic and digitized labor market.\n\nDesign effective, government-backed incentives for redeployment and reskilling. As governments provide crisis support to businesses and individual workers, they can incentivize several important shifts that will help reshape economies to be more productive and equitable when they recover from the crisis. In return for financial support—such as subsidies and tax rebates—during the crisis, governments can require businesses to invest in training and upskilling their workforces. In Germany, for example, the recent Qualification Opportunities Act provides for government subsidies of companies’ employee training programs—with smaller businesses receiving proportionally greater subsidies. Up to 100 percent of training costs for microbusinesses and up to 50 percent for SMEs are covered by subsidy. Governments can also achieve other objectives, such as increasing registration of informal businesses and improving female participation in the economy, in return for financial support.\n\nRestarting vulnerable small businesses: The stalled job engine\n\nThe initiatives to reopen economies and redeploy and reskill displaced workers we have described will touch businesses of all sizes. But special focus will be needed on small businesses.\n\nGovernments around the world are already taking action to support and protect small enterprises. Some are purchasing goods and services, including through stockpiling and redirecting procurement to small vendors, directly from businesses that are experiencing revenue loss. Others are stepping up to offer direct subsidies, tax rebates, and payment deferrals.\n\nMore can be done—fast—to build on these initiatives. Ideas for action to restart and sustain the SME job engine include the following:\n\nHelp SMEs take advantage of online talent exchanges. Often, small businesses do not have access to the market information and technical infrastructure that can help them quickly redeploy labor or expand their portfolios of services. Governments can create a talent exchange dedicated to SMEs. They can also counsel SMEs regarding new opportunities that would leverage their current skills and capabilities, fast-track issuance of business licenses when needed, and offer technical support to transition service offerings—for example, for restaurants transitioning to delivery services. In all such efforts, governments could consider quickly reducing regulatory barriers—even if it is on an interim basis during the crisis.\n\nBuild alliances among large and small businesses. Governments and industry associations can engage large companies and industry leaders to take responsibility for entire sector ecosystems and value chains. Larger businesses can provide unique perspectives and practical advice to smaller businesses—for example, by helping a supplier, such as a sewer, transition to making cloth face masks as a short-term measure and by helping smaller businesses shift to remote work or digital channels. There are already examples of multinationals and state-owned enterprises stepping in to support SMEs, specifically in countries with fiscal constraints. In one country, a group of large companies and wealthy individuals have formed a relief fund for SMEs; the fund is considering taking equity stakes in the portfolios of SMEs in return for financial support during the crisis.\n\nProtect the most vulnerable segments of SMEs. Governments need to act fast to ensure that SMEs—including informal microenterprises and gig-economy workers—are included in relief and stimulus packages. For example, some have debated the employment status of gig-economy workers in the context of access to unemployment benefits. Minimum-wage and antidiscrimination laws may not apply to them, and retirement security is also a concern. Governments can also explore how to make sure that SMEs benefit from demand stimuli to reignite employment creation, which will entail making SMEs’ procurement rules much more effective than they have been up to now.\n\nIn many countries, COVID-19 infections are still doubling each week—or even faster. Responses to save jobs need to be even swifter: solutions and interventions must be designed and deployed in days, greatly accelerating processes that, in normal times, would take months. The suggestions described in this article may seem obvious to many, but sometimes obvious is not fast.

Many elements of business and life are being challenged; in some cases, the next normal may look very different as new ways of working are carried over into the future. Companies are doing their best to manage through this pandemic—from ensuring an effective crisis response, to managing supply-chain disruptions, to safeguarding the well-being of their employees by adjusting daily working practices.\n\nCustomer experience takes on a new meaning against this backdrop. Executives are typically approaching customer experience by creating seamless, convenient and engaging customer journeys; however, the needs of customers at the moment have shifted dramatically towards more essential concerns. A recent McKinsey survey of US consumers found that 64 percent of respondents have felt depressed, anxious, or both over the past several weeks, and 39 percent stated that they would be unable to pay their bills after one month of unemployment.\n\nLeading organizations are reorienting their customer-experience efforts to meet their customers’ primary needs, such as safety, security, and everyday convenience. These actions will inevitably speak louder than words in a world where companies are increasingly advertising a message of “we are here for you.” By consciously providing empathy and care during this crisis, companies can build a foundation of goodwill and long-lasting emotional connections with the communities they serve.\n\nSeven actions to demonstrate empathy for customers\n\nOver the past few months, companies have had to quickly adjust to COVID-19. The first step for many organizations was to stabilize operations and safeguard their own employees. From this position, companies can then find genuine, creative ways to show empathy and emotionally connect with their customers. Many have already begun to take seven actions related to individual safety, security and stability, convenience and ease of use, and emotional bonds and trust (exhibit).\n\nExhibit We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Minimize risk by reducing physical interaction\n\nSociety’s first responsibility during a pandemic of this scale is eliminating opportunities to spread the virus, especially among the most at-risk populations. Companies have been minimizing the risk of contagion when fulfilling essential tasks, particularly when they involve vulnerable groups.\n\nGrocery retailers have responded by taking extra precautions, such as extending opening hours for the elderly and healthcare workers as well as free home-delivery for customers more than 65 years old. Many are limiting the number of people who can be inside the store at once and putting physical-distance stickers on the floor to aid compliance. E-commerce and online food-delivery companies around the world are offering new contactless delivery options to eliminate direct physical contact between customers and delivery drivers. Companies offering services that require customers to be in close proximity, such as airlines, are taking measures to reduce risk and ensure the health and safety of both their customers and employees. Of course, this approach requires more stringent standards for cleaning as well as new work processes, such as suspending drink refills or recycling to avoid touching passenger-handled items.\n\n2. Actively contribute to safety by innovating the product portfolio\n\nCompanies should ask themselves two critical questions: Do we have a product the world needs right now? Or can we rapidly adapt our product portfolio to provide goods that are urgently needed? In pursuing this approach, companies can use their strengths to provide essential products, even if those goods are outside of their current product offering. For example, some distilleries are using their ethanol supplies to provide materials for hand sanitizers through partnerships with refineries.\n\nCompanies are also stepping up to meet the demand for more medical equipment and personal protective equipment. Apparel manufacturers are responding to a drop in sales by producing thousands of urgently needed face masks instead. Some automotive companies are shifting production to manufacture ventilators, for example, General Motors is partnering with a US-based medical device company to produce respiratory care products.\n\nWould you like to learn more about our Marketing & Sales Practice\n\nCompanies beyond manufacturing are still able to innovate their product portfolio to contribute to safety initiatives. Rideshare companies are looking to use their network of drivers to transport medicine and basic goods, rather than passengers. This effort could provide lifesaving drugs to individuals who are not able to go out to purchase them because of the quarantine or other conditions.\n\nIn all of these cases, company leaders have demonstrated their commitment to customers and society. At the same time, they are creating alternatives so they can continue providing meaningful work for their employees despite substantial demand reductions in their core business.\n\n3. Provide pragmatic help to customers in financial distress\n\nOnce customers have secured their personal safety, their next concern is often financial. As companies are forced to decrease operations for an uncertain time period, individuals and millions of small business owners face massive income and liquidity issues.\n\nProviding flexible solutions when dealing with financial challenges is now both a responsibility and a huge trust driver for companies. Financial institutions are not penalizing customers who cannot meet payment obligations for March. Telcos are not terminating service or enforcing late-payment fees for customers experiencing hardship for an extra 60 days. And energy companies are not shutting off power for nonpayment; in some cases, they are even reconnecting customers whose service had been turned off prior to the crisis.\n\nIn addition, companies are seeking to alleviate unexpected sources of financial stress as events unfold. Travel companies, including most major airlines, are waiving cancellation fees. Families who formerly relied on school lunches to feed their children can benefit from efforts such as those introduced by Burger King, which provides two free kids meals to Americans who make any purchase through the Burger King app.\n\n4. Bring joy and support the emotional needs of customers ‘trapped at home’\n\nMany people are forced to stay at home, and experience all the concerns that come along with having to do so. Companies are acting to make homelife more enjoyable and to also ensure the well-being of their customers.\n\nFamilies have to entertain their children at home for weeks to come, making access to online content a truly fundamental need. Telcos are providing free unlimited data for the next 60 days to all mobile customers with data plans. Entertainment companies have released content ahead of schedule: the Walt Disney Company, for example, released the family-friendly blockbuster Frozen 2 on its streaming platform, Disney+, three months earlier than planned. New York’s Metropolitan Opera offered free digital shows to entertain virtual audiences, while Google Arts & Culture has paired with museums around the world to curate virtual tours.\n\nOther companies are checking in with their customers to help relieve stress. Meditation and mindfulness providers, such as the Headspace app, will be providing free subscriptions to healthcare professionals and unlocking free content for consumers. Multiple organizations have launched online services that include food delivery and recipes, shared rides, online courses, and traditional financial services.\n\n5. Actively shift customers to online channels\n\nWith so many directives around the world to remain at home, companies that previously relied on physical operations have had to direct customers to online offerings.\n\nAs an example, since many gyms have been directed to close all physical facilities, they are now offering hundreds of free online home workout courses to all members. Companies offering virtual capabilities, as with Cisco’s Webex, are assisting schools and universities as they transition to remote learning by offering free tools for teachers, parents, and students to support the development of online-learning plans. Italian banks are encouraging the use of digital channels while providing tutorials for online banking. Medical providers are providing care through digital services, such as telemedicine, with health insurers supporting the initiative by offering zero copays.\n\nCompanies without online services can find ways to establish and scale online offerings with substantial demand from customers as their needs increasingly turn digital. This shift to online and digital channels has the potential to dramatically increase online traffic post-recovery.\n\n6. Stay reachable and treat customers with care in personal interactions\n\nWith physical channels such as bank branches and nongrocery retail stores closed, many customers are turning to other channels for questions and requests that require personal attention and care.\n\nService companies in telcos and banking are currently experiencing increased inbound call volumes in their contact centers while at the same time having to shift their customer-service centers to remote-working arrangements. For example, a leading European telco equipped 10,000 call-center agents with laptops and tool infrastructure within a week, enabling them to take calls from their homes. Companies that provide customers with additional guidance and support can maintain communication and engagement. Other companies have enhanced options for seeking information digitally; Erdos Group launched a WeChat program in China to offer virtual product consultations. Airlines facing traveler cancellations or trip changes are urging customers whose travel is not within 72 hours to address their needs through the company’s website.\n\nWhile most companies must address reachability, some companies, such as those in the medical industry, face callers who have significantly different types of questions than they did prior to the pandemic. Another key priority is proactively responding to this shift by training call-center agents to effectively manage these new questions. Cigna has established a 24/7 customer-resource center specifically to help customers with claims related to the novel coronavirus. Companies should reevaluate how to prepare their agents to address these emerging needs.\n\n7. Demonstrate care for the community through company values\n\nSidebar Forming a purpose-driven bond with customers Companies that show their commitment to the communities in which they operate could build a more loyal customer base in the long run. A 2019 McKinsey survey found that 64 percent of consumers choose to buy from brands they believe are doing social good—up from 13 percent in 2017. In another McKinsey study, 70 percent of respondents said they try to purchase products from companies they consider to be ethical. Gen Z, soon to become the largest consumer segment, is particularly socially minded. Some 65 percent of this segment strive to learn the origins of the products they consume. In addition, they are willing to hold organizations accountable if, for instance, a brand that touts diversity actually lacks diversity in its own ranks.\n\nCompanies can stay true to their vision while showing that they genuinely care about their customers. Actions taken during crises can help build trust and reinforce brand values (see sidebar, “Forming a purpose-driven bond with customers”).\n\nOne of the most talked-about company initiatives in Germany came from McDonald’s and ALDI. The two companies initiated a staff sharing plan so that interested McDonald’s workers from temporarily closed branches can redeploy at ALDI stores to ensure that the retailer can meet the currently increased customer demand. Supporting local communities while linking these efforts back to company values is exemplified by companies delivering free, fresh meals to medical workers in the cities they serve. Similarly, sustainable-footwear company Allbirds is giving free shoes to healthcare workers, and pharmacies and drugstores are also gearing up to donate space in their parking lots for medical testing.\n\nThe Alibaba Foundation has donated medical supplies to 14 countries in Asia and the United States and will also be publishing a digital handbook to share learnings from the COVID-19 experience in China. Tableau Software has developed a free data resource hub using case data compiled by leading educational and government research organizations to help stakeholders see and understand coronavirus data in near-real time. LinkedIn, through employee referrals, is providing free access to its premium features for a designated period of time to help employees at small businesses cope with the economic downturn.\n\nPublic service announcements and other on-brand communication can be used to send messages of unity: for example, Coca-Cola’s marketing has been reminding customers that “staying apart is the best way to stay united.”\n\nAll these efforts show a clear care for customers and an obligation to serve on the part of companies, bringing local or international communities together with new knowledge and resources. Every action taken by a company should reinforce what customers already know—that companies care and are willing to invest in helping their community.\n\nForging lasting connections with customers\n\nDuring times of crisis, leading companies are pivoting from marketing to helping and from fulfilling customer desires to meeting customer needs. Socially conscious organizations across sectors and geographies are finding ways to get involved and support their customers and communities.\n\nThe current COVID-19 outbreak is a global crisis and an opportunity for leaders to support their customers and communities. Leading in a caring, empathetic manner during these difficult times has the potential to create real connections that will outlive the social and economic impacts of the pandemic. And large companies should consider it a duty to serve the communities in which they do business.", "keywords": ["connecting", "needs", "times", "crisis", "provide", "company", "offering", "free", "online", "care", "customers", "providing", "companies"], "summary": "Companies offering services that require customers to be in close proximity, such as airlines, are taking measures to reduce risk and ensure the health and safety of both their customers and employees.\nProvide pragmatic help to customers in financial distressOnce customers have secured their personal safety, their next concern is often financial.\nTelcos are providing free unlimited data for the next 60 days to all mobile customers with data plans.\nCompanies that provide customers with additional guidance and support can maintain communication and engagement.\nEvery action taken by a company should reinforce what customers already know—that companies care and are willing to invest in helping their community.", "url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/connecting-with-customers-in-times-of-crisis", "rss_link": "http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/rss.aspx", "title": "Connecting with customers in times of crisis"}, {"authors": ["Gaurav Agrawal", "Hemant Ahlawat", "Martin Dewhurst", "About The Author S", "Gaurav Agrawal Is A Partner In Mckinsey S New York Office", "Hemant Ahlawat Is A Senior Partner In The Brussels Office", "Martin Dewhurst Is A Senior Partner In The London Office."], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "Downloadable Resources Open interactive popup\n\nPandemics, like other humanitarian crises, are times of great change and uncertainty. The society that emerges in the wake of COVID-19 will be different. People’s behavior and values will change in ways we can’t predict. Health systems will be fundamentally altered. The pace of adoption of some new technologies, such as telemedicine, may step up. Patient journeys will be transformed through new settings of care. Health systems will face different priorities and pressures on funding, depending on the depth of the economic downturn and the pace of recovery.\n\nIn these unprecedented times, the world is looking to the biopharma and medical-products industry for a response. Its contribution spans testing, ventilators and other critical medical devices, repurposed and novel therapeutics, and vaccines. Beyond that, it provides the only path to whatever next normal we may find on the other side. It is the source of hope and the primary path to mitigating and, ultimately, helping resolve a potential humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nHow companies act individually and collectively in the next few weeks and months will shape the outcome of the pandemic and the reputation of the biopharma industry for decades to come.\n\nOur thinking, like yours, is evolving from day to day. Below we share perspectives we have developed following discussions with industry leaders and stakeholders, and from what we are seeing more broadly. We have divided them into three horizons anchored in our 5R framework (Exhibit 1):\n\nImmediate crisis response (Resolve)—where most companies are today\n\nShaping the recovery (Resilience, Return)\n\nShaping the next normal (Reimagination, Reform)\n\nExhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nImmediate crisis response\n\nHere, our sense is that most companies have acted decisively in standing up “nerve centers” to plan for the challenges to come. We see the primary imperatives as follows:\n\nKeeping employees safe.\n\nManaging the transition to effective home working, using new technologies and exploring new ways of connecting.\n\nMaintaining business continuity: preparing for possible site closures and distribution delays; evaluating the need for new sources of supply for raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and outsourced products; introducing new safety measures.\n\nEnsuring the supply of medicines to patients and physicians and ensuring treatment and support for non-COVID-19 patients, some of whom are particularly vulnerable to the virus. Some companies in the United States have recently taken the step of extending their patient support programs with this in mind.\n\nIdentifying immediate implications across the value chain, by market and by therapeutic area, and, where applicable, planning how to respond to huge spikes in demand that are putting pressure on supply chains.\n\nMobilizing to help fight the pandemic by contributing to the supply of tests, medical equipment, and devices as well as the development of repurposed therapies and vaccines. As of early April, we tracked more than 200 vaccine and therapeutic candidates in development—an unprecedented level of mobilization within three months. Companies are also stepping in to donate funds or products—such as Novartis, Bayer, and Sanofi, who have committed to donating chloroquine, should that prove effective in addressing the virus—and adding their capabilities and expertise to national and global efforts.\n\nShaping the recovery\n\nThe key is for the industry to engage proactively, and positive signs are already emerging. We urge companies to take a health systems’ view and ask where we can make the biggest difference.\n\nAt a company level, we encourage you to set up a plan-ahead team that works across all time horizons to help you to stay on top of escalating issues and make the right decisions. To navigate the huge uncertainties ahead, model a broad range of scenarios covering both the epidemiological and economic perspectives. We have developed nine macro economy-wide scenarios and explored four in greater depth (Exhibit 2). The implications for each company will of course differ.\n\nExhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nTo help shape the recovery, consider the following critical steps:\n\nTaking an end-to-end view across the value chain to assess the implications from the pandemic and identifying the challenges and areas where the disruptions from the pandemic may accelerate change.\n\nStaying close to your customers and stakeholders. In particular, what do healthcare providers need? When will they have the capacity to engage with you?\n\nPlanning how to support patients through uncertain and anxious times, focusing on how they are experiencing the crisis and taking a granular view by therapy area and geography. Different health systems will emerge from the crisis at different rates and in different ways. There may be stark differences even within countries such as the United States and China.\n\nLooking across your business, consider the following:\n\nAccelerating your transformation, especially in using digital and analytics tools and adopting digital channels to engage with healthcare professionals, such as telemedicine or remote consultation. In a recent April survey, physicians reported a sixfold spike in remote patient engagement across specialties and geographies—a trend that many of these physicians believe will endure post-crisis. New channels may also emerge to further address patient needs during the crisis. The use of customer-facing field personnel also could be uncertain for some time to come. In China, some pharma companies have used the enforced pause to refine their go-to-market model and invest in digital capability building for physician engagement.\n\nNew channels may also emerge to further address patient needs during the crisis. The use of customer-facing field personnel also could be uncertain for some time to come. In China, some pharma companies have used the enforced pause to refine their go-to-market model and invest in digital capability building for physician engagement. Developing contingency plans for launches over the next six to 12 months, recognizing that health systems are coming under enormous strain in many markets, with the pandemic putting frontline healthcare professionals at considerable risk and exacting a heavy personal toll.\n\nSeizing opportunities presented by remote working and spare capacity among field sales representatives and other groups to accelerate capability development. Past experience indicates that the capability gap between those who successfully adapt and those who fall behind widens during crises. We are seeing companies building muscle in driving change and boosting digital and analytics skills among key cohorts.\n\nTaking a forensic view of your supply chain and operations to derisk key elements such as in-market supply, while also deepening your capabilities in data availability and transparency and modelling capacity needs.\n\nDeveloping granular, data-backed plans on “when” and “how” to restart paused trials as well as ensuring existing trials can continue to retain patients using quick-win tools, such as telemedicine, sending drugs directly to patients, and travelling nurses. At an industry level, more than 2,800 trials and nearly a million trial patients—accounting for more than 80 percent of multisite trials sponsored by pharma companies—are at sites that are in locations that are now partly or fully locked due to COVID-19. In addition, starting new trials and sites in this environment is challenging; a recent survey showed that over 75 pharma and biotech companies are facing significant disruption in their clinical trials. One especially urgent task is to identify and decide how to address those trials for which data may already be compromised.\n\nOne especially urgent task is to identify and decide how to address those trials for which data may already be compromised. Accelerating productivity improvements to create head room to respond to the pricing and access challenges that major economic shocks could bring, and taking a forward-looking view on how to increase the agility of operating models for countries and therapeutic areas to handle demand shocks better.\n\nEvaluating bold moves, such as undertaking M&A in adjacent segments or deepening integration between digital and health tech.\n\nAt an industry level, we see many signs that companies are coming together in exciting new ways. We believe now is the time for a critical shift from a competitive to a collaborative mindset based on shared humanitarian goals. By pooling capabilities, pharma companies could unleash a huge wave of innovation. Positive steps to consider include the following:\n\nContinuing to deepen your collaborations in R&D, including supporting biotechs by providing them with access to your capabilities and capacity, and sharing data, assets (such as compound libraries), and platforms to accelerate the approval of vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nWorking with industry peers to shape new modes of engagement with regulatory bodies and establishing trial infrastructure and regulations that are better equipped to withstand future disruptions with more robust data management, remote trial capabilities, and real-world-evidence-based regulatory processes.\n\nDeepening collaboration in manufacturing, taking advantage of collective capacity and capabilities to rapidly scale up vaccines and therapeutics, particularly from biotechs. An encouraging collaboration model is the recent announcement by several plasma manufacturers to work collectively to produce a single unbranded product.\n\nContinuing to commit resources to support the needs of health systems. For example, Pfizer and Merck are enabling employees who are licensed medical professionals to volunteer on the frontlines providing services such as public-health support, diagnostic testing and treatments, and patient services. Eli Lilly has medical professionals staffing a free drive-through COVID-19 testing facility at its corporate headquarters in Indianapolis as a service to the community.\n\nEngaging in transparent, responsible behavior, as exemplified in AbbVie’s decision to give up its intellectual-property protection on Kaletra. Proactive engagement with external stakeholders—regulators, global agencies, health systems—will help the whole healthcare ecosystem navigate the fast-evolving crisis.\n\nWe propose taking a dynamic view of emerging scenarios, identifying no-regrets moves and looking for ways to emerge stronger from the crisis.\n\nShaping the next normal\n\nThis is the right moment to start shaping how you want to be operating two years from now and reflect on the choices that you will have to make as a biopharma leader. At a company level, you will need to navigate numerous uncertainties, including the level of economic disruption caused by the pandemic, and the nature of the response from governments, regulators, and health systems. This will be a marathon, not a sprint. We propose taking a dynamic view of emerging scenarios, identifying no-regrets moves and looking for ways to emerge stronger from the crisis. Shaping the next normal could involve the following:\n\nCommitting to pushing the boundaries on digital, data and analytics, and customer-centricity—for both patients and healthcare professionals.\n\nEvolving your perspective across the value chain and ecosystem, including the greater use of shared platforms in research.\n\nEmbracing both patient- and principal investigator–centricity to drive trial design and conduct: including protocols that reduce patient burden and, as one of many tools toward that goal, deploying digital and remote engagement platforms, such as remote assessment of vitals and end-points, to increase virtualization of trials. Among major pharma companies, 60 percent are already using telemedicine for trial visits in response to the COVID-19 crisis and more seem likely to follow.\n\ncrisis and more seem likely to follow. Looking across the value chain to identify how to build more resilience in the network and finding the right trade-off between global efficiency and local resilience. Implementing operations and supply chain 4.0, with greater site automation and more flexible manufacturing platforms, could speed up supply–demand response rates. With an “Amazonification” of the pharmacy value chain on the horizon, companies also need to prepare to service new direct-to-patient channels.\n\nConsidering bold moves in areas such as productivity improvements and cost reductions, M&A, new ecosystems of collaborations, and increased use of health tech to improve patient outcomes.\n\nAcross the industry, we believe companies need to work together not only to shape both a positive outcome for the pandemic but to safeguard their broad license to operate in the decades ahead. There is a real imperative for change to get to a better next normal. Here are our suggestions:\n\nDeepening engagement with governments, bearing in mind the potential implications of more locally driven agendas over the next few years, with respect to local manufacturing capacity, and product security. Indeed, governments may see health through a similar lens to that of defense—one of national security requiring controls.\n\nCollaborating with relevant stakeholders to shape an economic model that makes it compelling for the industry to invest in preventing pandemics and working on areas subject to market failures, such as anti-infectives and antimicrobial resistance. How can the industry ensure lessons are learned from the crisis so that nothing on this scale can ever happen again?\n\nPlanning for other possible “black swan” events, such as biosecurity hazards and cybersecurity threats.\n\nBuilding closer industry-wide collaboration in R&D and manufacturing, with fewer silos and faster joint innovation, and cultivating a new mindset of collaboration both across the industry and between biotech and universities.\n\nConsidering the potential for a more fundamental shift to prevention (which typically accounts for just 4 to 6 percent of today’s healthcare spending), giving greater prominence to considerations for the health of the broader population and raising questions on how the industry should participate in this broader dialogue.\n\nDeveloping new contracts and nurturing closer relationships with health systems, payers, healthcare professionals, and patients.\n\nThis is a historic moment of danger and opportunity—or, in Mandarin, 危机, the two characters that make up the word “crisis.” It is no exaggeration to say the industry holds our future in its hands.", "keywords": ["winning", "patient", "systems", "industry", "crisis", "digital", "supply", "biopharma", "trials", "implications", "view", "covid19", "companies", "health"], "summary": "Health systems will be fundamentally altered.\nHealth systems will face different priorities and pressures on funding, depending on the depth of the economic downturn and the pace of recovery.\nWe urge companies to take a health systems’ view and ask where we can make the biggest difference.\nContinuing to commit resources to support the needs of health systems.\nDeveloping new contracts and nurturing closer relationships with health systems, payers, healthcare professionals, and patients.", "url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/pharmaceuticals-and-medical-products/our-insights/winning-against-covid-19-the-implications-for-biopharma", "rss_link": "http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/rss.aspx", "title": "Winning against COVID-19: The implications for biopharma"}, {"authors": ["Harald Bauer", "Ondrej Burkacky", "Peter Kenevan", "Abhijit Mahindroo", "Mark Patel", "About The Author S", "Harald Bauer Is A Senior Partner In", "Mckinsey S Frankfurt Office", "Ondrej Burkacky Is A Partner In The Munich Office", "Peter Kenevan Is A Senior Partner In The Tokyo Office"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "Downloadable Resources Open interactive popup\n\nDespite ongoing quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and other stringent measures, COVID-19 has continued to spread. As deaths climb and the human toll mounts, leaders are focused on containing the virus and saving lives. In parallel, efforts are under way to mitigate the devastating economic consequences of COVID-19, which include business shutdowns, record unemployment, and unprecedented drops in gross domestic product (GDP) across many countries.\n\nThe semiconductor industry, which has historically been a major source of high-tech jobs, is among the many sectors that have had to adjust their production planning and operations as COVID-19 shifts demand for major semiconductor end applications. In addition to exploring the impact of such changes on semiconductor demand, this article provides insights about the industry’s evolution post-crisis and outlines how semiconductor leaders should prepare themselves for the next normal.\n\nImpact of COVID-19 on global semiconductor demand\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis is unprecedented in our time. While the recession during the financial crisis from 2007 to 2008 was driven by stagnating consumer demand, the COVID-19 situation induced a shock to both global demand and supply, creating a dual challenge. This unique phenomenon makes it difficult to extrapolate from past crises to make predictions.\n\nNevertheless, this article aims to provide guidance on how semiconductor demand will shift in the short- and mid-term—taking into account extensive surveys, research on the recovering Chinese market, and global GDP projections. Our GDP projections in this article are based on two of the nine scenarios that McKinsey developed for global GDP recovery, both of which assume that the spread of coronavirus is eventually controlled and catastrophic economic damage is avoided. In the first scenario, global GDP recovers in the fourth quarter of 2020; in the second, recovery is delayed until late 2022. All demand forecasts are shown as a percentage of 2019 market sizes.\n\nSidebar Demand drivers of semiconductor end-applications This chart shows the main end-user applications that incorporate semiconductors, as well as the primary factors that drive semiconductor demand in each category. Exhibit We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nBased on the two scenarios we evaluated, we expect demand to decline by 5 to 15 percent for the semiconductor industry as a whole this year compared to 2019 (Exhibit 1). Breaking down this projection by major end markets—PC or server, wireless communication, wired communication, consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial applications—shows that demand shifts vary greatly, with steep declines anticipated for some markets and gains expected in others. These differences can be explained by the diversity of underlying trends that affect demand for semiconductors, and the varying impact of macroeconomic forces on each end market. (See sidebar, “Demand drivers of semiconductor end-applications.”)\n\nExhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nPC or server\n\nWe expect chip demand for the PC and server end market to drop by 1 to 7 percent this year, with results varying by product.\n\nDemand for PC semiconductors will decline by an estimated 3 to 9 percent in 2020, mostly because companies will delay planned hardware upgrades and other long-term migration projects. Stable laptop and tablet demand will partly offset this drop, since many consumers will upgrade their private IT infrastructure to support their work or homeschooling activities, even if they are cutting back in other areas. These one-time IT equipment upgrades will not be repeated to the same extent in later years if the downturn persists and consumers cut back spending even further. This fact, combined with enterprises decreasing computer replacements to manage their liquidity, could further erode semiconductor sales after 2020 if the crisis persists.\n\nThrough late 2020, the semiconductor market for servers could increase by 1 to 7 percent, driven by a strong uptick in video streaming and conferencing as more people work from home. Demand for enterprise IT and enterprise cloud solutions is expected to remain stable or show a minor decline as some companies cut IT budgets while others accelerate their cloud-migration plans. Increased server demand may not persist past 2020, however. If the global economy continues to struggle after the fourth quarter of 2020, more companies will cut IT budgets—a trend that will outweigh any additional increases in video streaming.\n\nWireless communication\n\nDemand for semiconductors used in wireless communication applications will see one of the sharpest drops in 2020, with an expected decrease of 11 to 26 percent. The level of mobile-phone sales, the primary demand driver in this category, has historically been well correlated with GDP and thus is expected to drop significantly over the coming months. (Sharp decreases have already been documented in areas where COVID-19 is prevalent, especially China). We also expect consumer preferences to shift to less expensive phones, which will also negatively affect demand for semiconductors. The recovery of mobile-phone sales will vary by geography, with China likely to see an uptick before Europe and the United States, since its economy is closer to recovery.\n\nFor wireless communication infrastructure—5G in particular—we expect to see two different demand patterns. In areas that have not launched 5G networks, telecom providers will likely postpone investments and instead focus on improving their existing networks to accommodate rising data traffic. By contrast, some telecom providers in areas that already have 5G will double down on their investments, especially if governments provide subsidies in an attempt to stimulate the local GDP.\n\nWired communication\n\nDemand for semiconductors used in wired communication applications will increase by 8 to 11 percent in 2020 because of several pandemic-related factors, including:\n\nmore security upgrades for existing enterprise infrastructures as more employees work from home\n\na more than 50 percent increase in fixed broadband usage in some countries, leading to more purchases of cable/DSL and wireless routers as workers upgrade internet connections in private home offices\n\nhigher internet traffic, which will spur demand for switches and routers\n\ngreater demand for cloud services and associated computing nodes, which will increase the need for optoelectronics in data center fiber connections\n\na more than 40 percent increase in video streaming across many networks\n\nEven if the economic downturn persists after 2020, demand for semiconductors used in wired communication will still grow. Annual growth may not remain as high as the 8 to 11 percent seen in 2020, however, since many of the mentioned investments are one-time purchases that will reduce future replacement needs.\n\nConsumer electronics\n\nSemiconductor companies provide components for many consumer-electronics products, including video games, televisions, and watches. Consumers use discretionary funds to purchase most products in this category, so demand is highly correlated with local GDP. We expect demand for consumer-electronics semiconductors to drop by 2 to 12 percent in 2020. While significant, this decrease is lower than the drop seen within wireless communication—another area where end-market sales are closely tied to local GDP.\n\nConsumer electronics are faring better than wireless communication because of a recent rise in demand for gaming devices, audio equipment, and some kitchen appliances—a trend likely occurring because people are spending more time at home. Although this increase has partly offset the significant declines reported for other consumer-electronics products, it likely stems from one-off purchases and thus will not persist over time. In consequence, the decreased demand for consumer-electronic semiconductors will extend beyond 2020.\n\nWould you like to learn more about our Semiconductors Practice\n\nAutomotive\n\nSales of semiconductors for automotive applications primarily depend on car sales volume and the level of vehicle digitization and electrification. Since global automotive demand has already fallen sharply this year and will likely decline further over coming months, the automotive semiconductor market is expected to decrease by 10 to 27 percent in 2020. Semiconductor companies will likely not feel any effect until late in the second quarter, however, due to the long lead times of automotive semiconductors.\n\nIn terms of semiconductor demand, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and electric vehicles (EV) are particularly important, since they contain more semiconductors than combustion-engine vehicles. Currently, we expect that the decline in demand for HEVs and EVs will be similar to that for other vehicles, leaving their market share constant. That said, semiconductor companies should watch out for certain developments that might increase or decrease the share of HEVs and EVs in the market. For instance, increased government subsidies may spur additional demand for HEVs and EVs, while less stringent emissions regulations or continued low oil prices might push sales down.\n\nIndustrial applications\n\nWithin industrial applications, the major demand drivers for semiconductors include investments in medical electronics, aerospace equipment, power and energy products, as well as upgrades to lighting solutions. Demand is expected to decline for all of these end markets through 2020 as companies postpone infrastructure investments, reduce manufacturing activities, or decrease operations. Overall, semiconductor demand for industrial applications is expected to fall 1 to 11 percent this year.\n\nFor medical electronics, demand in certain medical-device categories that are directly related to the management of COVID-19, including ventilators, X-ray machines, and diagnostic tools, has sharply increased since the start of the outbreak. However, there will be even steeper demand declines in other areas that will offset such extreme demand spikes for critical treatment products because many hospitals are postponing purchases to improve liquidity.\n\nStrategies for semiconductor companies\n\nLike all business leaders, semiconductor executives are wondering how they can adapt to sudden changes in demand, as well as other uncertainties associated with COVID-19. They may find a path forward by following a framework that McKinsey created to assist companies on their journey to the next normal. It includes five stages: resolve, resilience, return, reimagine, and reform (Exhibit 2).\n\nExhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nMost semiconductor companies have already passed through the first two phases or are currently addressing challenges related to reduced workforce availability and near-term cash management. Experience has also shown, however, that companies should do far more than handling operational challenges during economic downturns if they want to emerge stronger post-crisis. Despite focusing on operational issues that require immediate attention, semiconductor leaders would also benefit by thinking ahead—and that will involve progressing through the return, reimagine, and reform phases as quickly as possible.\n\nReturn\n\nWhen planning for the return to the next normal, semiconductor leaders should determine if they need to revise any critical business activities in response to the changed demand dynamics. As they set their course, they may benefit by focusing on the following tasks:\n\nAdjusting demand planning. How long will it take until an increase or decrease in customer demand affects orders for semiconductors and how steep will the decline be?\n\nRevising production planning. Can the business adjust its production plans and make costs more variable to reflect changing customer demand and/or labor shortages?\n\nRevisiting sourcing strategy. How does the closure of country borders and the potential financial distress of suppliers affect sourcing operations?\n\nRevising product pricing. Will the company’s product-pricing strategy be affected by changing logistics costs and/or our customers’ willingness to pay?\n\nRevising previous business practices. Based on the company’s experience with remote work during the pandemic, do any business practices need to be revised, or even removed?\n\nReimagine\n\nAs semiconductor companies start to reimagine a new normal for their industry, they should create dedicated working teams that follow up closely on the following topics.\n\nChanging industry dynamics. New technologies that helped in the fight against COVID-19 could permanently change how companies work. Some shifts in work processes and consumer behavior that arose during the pandemic might also persist, and these could open both new markets and routes to market. Semiconductor players might place more emphasis on digital marketing, for instance.\n\nGrowth stimulation. Governments may soon provide subsidies, such as incentives for further 5G roll outs, to stimulate the economy in multiple industries. Other government subsidies might encourage local production or investments in healthcare. Such changes could lead to faster technology adoption, and semiconductor companies might need to re-evaluate their product road maps.\n\nSourcing shifts. Companies along the value chain are likely to revise their sourcing strategies. For semiconductor players, this might involve further leveraging foundries and decreasing their reliance on critical suppliers.\n\nSome shifts in work processes and consumer behavior that arose during the pandemic might also persist, and these could open both new markets and routes to market.\n\nReform\n\nThroughout the reform phase, semiconductor companies should monitor changes in the following areas.\n\nRegulatory environment. Trade tensions are unlikely to increase significantly over the short term, since economies are still highly interlinked and governments will likely be cautious about causing additional stress in industries that are still striving to recover. If governments decide to subsidize local sourcing and manufacturing activities, however, opportunities could open for fast movers.\n\nCompetitive environment. As the crisis drains liquidity from companies, and valuations take a significant hit (with high variance, depending on semiconductor end market exposure), we are likely to observe increased M&A activities. The companies involved should monitor potential regulatory constraints on foreign purchases.\n\nStrategic next steps\n\nAs companies proceed through the five phases that will take them to the next normal, they could strengthen their muscles by evaluating and capturing strategic opportunities at a fast pace.\n\nAfter the financial crisis of 2007 to 2008, the semiconductor companies that emerged strongest were those that implemented bold moves and thus contributed to reforming the industry. They maintained relatively higher capital expenditures and R&D spending compared with their competitors and were more active in pursuing M&As. Current leaders might want to consider similar options.\n\nBefore making such moves, semiconductor companies might want to reassess their baseline position, since the coronavirus pandemic may have altered it considerably, and then look at both potential opportunities and business threats that may arise over multiple time horizons. Companies must quickly move from strategic plans to action, however, since many opportunities may open up quickly and only be available for a limited time. Some leaders might want to define specific trigger points—events that will move them to act—as they create their plans.\n\nMarket dynamics in the semiconductor industry are rapidly changing. Demand is moving in different directions, and to different extents, depending on the application segment involved.

But it is also an economic downturn. This raises the question: To what extent are the lessons of previous downturns relevant?\n\nThe private equity (PE) industry is still fairly young, though old enough to remember 2008. We looked briefly at two aspects of how the industry confronted the last economic downturn for hints on what may drive value in this one. In brief: operating groups appear to matter; and “buying low” is great, if you can.\n\nPE firms with portfolio value-creation teams outperformed in the last crisis\n\nWe analyzed 120 of the largest PE firms, which included many with specialist teams focused on driving value creation in portfolio-company operations, and many without such teams. We compared their investment returns and their fundraising over 2004–18, looking at five-year periods before, including, and after the global financial crisis that started in 2008 (Exhibit 1).\n\nExhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nBefore and after the crisis, both groups of firms performed comparably (about 13 percent net internal rate of return (IRR) for vintages 2004–08 and about 21 percent for vintages 2014–18). But during the crisis years, firms with value-creation teams meaningfully outpaced the others, achieving about five full percentage points more in IRR (23 percent) than firms without portfolio-operating groups (18 percent).\n\nFirms with value-creation teams also saw less disruption in fundraising in the crisis period, with their fund size falling 19 percent on average versus 82 percent for general partners (GPs) without an operating team. This fundraising advantage proved durable, as firms with value-creation teams saw fund size rise by 53 percent in the post-crisis years, while those without experienced 15 percent further declines in fund size.\n\nThe lesson for GPs today is self-evident—albeit hard to put into practice once already under duress. While correlation is not causation, there appears to be a strong relationship between having a portfolio value-creation team and outperforming in tough times. PE firms without such a team will likely find that assembling, let alone deploying, a high-caliber group in the midst of a global crisis may not be possible. As firms consider their options, they should note that a big team is not necessarily needed: a separate McKinsey research effort has found that the size of the operating group is not clearly correlated to fund performance or fund size. Larger firms tend to have slightly bigger teams, but there is no hard and fast rule.\n\nOther options for GPs without these internal capabilities are to redirect dealmakers with operational bona fides toward the portfolio, or seek to bolster portfolio companies with strong operators to meet pressing needs. (Many firms also maintain strong links to trusted third-party advisers, who can play a part.)\n\nMeanwhile, GPs that have an operating team can take some comfort in their prescience. The data suggest that firms’ substantial investments in these groups have paid off. This analysis also validates the decision making of limited partners (LPs), who have voted with their feet in the same direction.\n\nIt is easier to sell high when you’ve bought low\n\nThere are many ways to lose out in a crisis. Common ones include deploying too much capital at the peak; selling too much in a panic at or near the bottom; and, often as bad or worse, sitting nervously on the sidelines as prices resume their climb. During the GFC, many investors made all of these mistakes, paying multiple times for what in hindsight is dubbed a “lack of discipline.” Thus chastened, GPs and LPs alike have pledged over the last decade to “maintain pricing discipline” and “avoid vintage risk” and “stick to pacing plans.”\n\nThis logic appears to be borne out by the data. Our analysis of 500 PE firms confirms that those which maintained their capital-deployment rate tended to outperform (Exhibit 2).\n\nExhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nIt is hard to be entirely wrong when arguing that investors should seek to buy low and sell high. Yet it is, of course, not quite that simple. Today’s “low” may turn out to be tomorrow’s “not yet that low.” The cheap debt financing that was so plentiful a few months ago is suddenly scarce. Many sellers are less excited to exit at current prices.\n\nAt the same time, it is a fact that public-market comparables are lower than they have been in several years. It is a fact that the PE industry has a historically large stockpile of dry powder. And it increasingly appears that for every newly unmotivated seller, there may be one or two others that find themselves with previously unexpected financing needs. So, notwithstanding the recent slowdown in deal activity, it is reasonable to imagine that many PE firms will seek to continue deploying capital despite the current tumult and uncertainty.", "keywords": ["equity", "firms", "private", "pe", "crisis", "downturn", "gps", "fund", "valuecreation", "portfolio", "teams", "size", "team", "lessons"], "summary": "The private equity (PE) industry is still fairly young, though old enough to remember 2008.\nPE firms with portfolio value-creation teams outperformed in the last crisisWe analyzed 120 of the largest PE firms, which included many with specialist teams focused on driving value creation in portfolio-company operations, and many without such teams.\nWhile correlation is not causation, there appears to be a strong relationship between having a portfolio value-creation team and outperforming in tough times.\nOur analysis of 500 PE firms confirms that those which maintained their capital-deployment rate tended to outperform (Exhibit 2).\nSo, notwithstanding the recent slowdown in deal activity, it is reasonable to imagine that many PE firms will seek to continue deploying capital despite the current tumult and uncertainty.", "url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/lessons-for-private-equity-from-the-last-downturn", "rss_link": "http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/rss.aspx", "title": "Lessons for private equity from the last downturn"}, {"authors": ["Kevin Sneader", "Shubham Singhal", "About The Author S", "The Global Managing Partner Of Mckinsey", "Is Based In Mckinsey S Hong Kong Office", "The Global Leader Of The Healthcare Systems", "Services Practice", "Is A Senior Partner In The Detroit Office."], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "Downloadable Resources Open interactive popup\n\nDealing with the coronavirus crisis and its aftermath could be the imperative of our times. Indeed, we have argued that it augurs the “imminent restructuring of the global economic order.” As Ian Davis, one of our previous managing partners, wrote in 2009 in the midst of the global financial crisis:\n\n“For some organizations, near-term survival is the only agenda item. Others are peering through the fog of uncertainty, thinking about how to position themselves once the crisis has passed and things return to normal. The question is, ‘What will normal look like?’ While no one can say how long the crisis will last, what we find on the other side will not look like the normal of recent years.”\n\nIt is impossible to know what will happen. But it is possible to consider the lessons of the past, both distant and recent, and on that basis, to think constructively about the future. We believe the following elements will be important in the shaping of the next normal—and that business leaders will need to come to terms with them.\n\n1. Distance is back\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the idea of the “death of distance” gained currency. The thinking was that new web-based and telecom technologies had made it possible to communicate and work in new ways that dramatically reduced the value of physical proximity. As the flow of information became cheap and seamless, global supply chains of bewildering complexity were able to deliver just-in-time products as a matter of routine. Cross-border trade reached new peaks. And the world’s burgeoning middle class took to travel and tourism with something like abandon.\n\nEven before COVID-19 hit, there were signs of unease, expressed in calls for protectionism and more restrictive immigration and visa policies. In these ways, people sought, in effect, to create more distance from those unlike themselves.\n\nSuch attitudes were far from universal, of course. But to deal with the pandemic, governments around the world have imposed restrictions on people and goods of a severity not seen for decades. According to one study, more than three billion people live in countries whose borders are now totally closed to nonresidents; 93 percent live in countries that have imposed new limits on entry, because of the coronavirus. If a modern-day Hannibal wanted to cross the Alps peacefully, his elephants would be turned away. Eventually, the tourists will come back and the borders will reopen, but it is certainly possible that the previous status quo will not return.\n\nIndeed, for businesses, the prospect of more border restrictions; a greater preference for local over global products and services; the need for resilience across supply chains driving a move to bring sourcing closer to end markets (see element 2, “Resilience AND efficiency”); and perhaps renewed resistance to globalization, are all possible second-order consequences of the actions being taken now to cope with the coronavirus. Technology continues to shrink physical distance, but in other ways, it could be set for a return.\n\n2. Resilience AND efficiency\n\nEven when lockdown restrictions begin to ease, businesses will need to figure out how to operate in new ways. In short, resiliency—the ability to absorb a shock, and to come out of it better than the competition—will be the key to survival and long-term prosperity.\n\nAgain, the past can be a prelude. McKinsey research on the 2008 financial crisis found that a small group of companies in each sector outperformed their peers. They did get hurt, with revenues falling about the industry average, but they recovered much faster. By 2009, the earnings of the resilient companies had risen 10 percent, while that of the nonresilients had gone down almost 15 percent. What characterized the resilient companies was preparation before the crisis—they typically had stronger balance sheets—and effective action during it—specifically, their ability to cut operating costs.\n\nThis advice is still sound—but insufficient. COVID-19 could end up dwarfing the financial crisis in economic damage. In that case, it will not be enough for many companies to tweak their business model; instead, they will need to rethink it.\n\nOne implication of this has to do with how supply chains operate; companies are finding themselves vulnerable because they cannot get the parts they need. Supply chains built on just-in-time inventory and distributed component sourcing may well have to be reconsidered, given the way many have been disrupted. Instead, companies will want to build backup and safety plans.\n\nOther key elements of business structure will also be revisited. For example, the Wall Street Journal observed that the crisis has revealed weaknesses in succession plans as leaders get sick and deputies quickly need to be found across all aspects of operations. Companies are learning the hard way that succession planning has to go much deeper than the C-suite, and much broader, responding to possible short-term disruptions as well.\n\nInvestors are likely to take note, and to devise ways to incorporate resiliency more systematically into their valuations. Indeed, in the wake of recent natural disasters, the impact of climate change was increasingly being recognized by business leaders and investors, with consequent effects on decision making and valuations. This pressure to include environmental, social, and governance factors in valuing a business is likely to expand to incorporate resilience to outside shocks, such as pandemics. In sum, many companies will rebalance their priorities, so that resiliency—in all its manifestations—becomes just as important to their strategic thinking as cost and efficiency.\n\n3. The rise of the contact-free economy\n\nIn three areas in particular—digital commerce, telemedicine, and automation—the COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be a decisive turning point.\n\nE-commerce was already meaningfully and visibly eating into the sales of brick-and-mortar stores. What the coronavirus has done is to accelerate a change in shopping habits that was already well established. Early indications from China, for example, are that new customers and markets—specifically individuals aged 36 and over and residents of smaller, less prosperous cities—have begun to shop online in greater numbers. In Europe, 13 percent of consumers said in early April that they were planning to browse online e-tailers for the first time. In Italy alone, e-commerce transactions have risen 81 percent since the end of February.\n\nThe figures for telemedicine and virtual health are just as striking. Teladoc Health, the largest US stand-alone telemedicine service, reported a 50 percent increase in service in the week ending March 20, and is adding thousands of doctors to its network. The Federal Communications Commission is spending $200 million to improve connectivity between patients and virtual-healthcare providers, and the US Department of Health and Human Services has increased reimbursements for telemedicine and enabled cross-state provision of virtual care. Sweden’s KRY International, one of Europe’s biggest telehealth providers, reported that registrations were up more than 200 percent. France and Korea have both changed regulations to ease access to telemedicine. With a vaccine or treatment at least months away, patients and healthcare providers both have reason to expand virtual interactions.\n\nGreater automation was already occurring before COVID-19. In late 2017, the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that 60 percent of all jobs could see more than 30 percent of their key tasks automated, affecting 400 million to 800 million jobs around the world by 2030. According to the Brookings Institution, over the three recessions that have occurred over the past 30 years, the pace of automation increased during each.\n\nIn effect, it is becoming possible to imagine a world of business—from the factory floor to the individual consumer—in which human contact is minimized. But not eliminated: for many people, getting back to normal will include popping into stores again, and the roadside kiosks typical of much of the developing world are not about to be replaced by cashless hyperstores. Patients with complex needs will still want to see their doctors in person, and many kinds of jobs are not automatable. But the trends are unmistakable—and probably irreversible.\n\n4. More government intervention in the economy\n\nDuring times of great crisis, such as World War II, citizens have proved willing to accept—even embrace—greater government control of the economy. Already, there has been economic intervention on a scale that hasn’t been seen for decades, if at all. As of April 10, governments across the globe had announced stimulus plans amounting to $10.6 trillion—the equivalent of eight Marshall Plans. Most spending is directed to three areas—supporting citizens’ basic needs, preserving jobs, and helping businesses to survive another day.\n\nIndia is making direct cash transfers to needy citizens, and Indonesia is expanding social-welfare benefits to ten million more households. Britain and France are covering wages (up to 80 percent) of workers affected by COVID-19; Italy is suspending loan and mortgage payments; Brazil is easing labor regulations on companies. And central banks from Australia to Europe to South Africa to Canada are cutting rates.\n\nAs governments step up to serve, or save, the private sector, the means they choose will differ. Some countries will outright nationalize, some will take equity stakes, some will provide loans, and others will choose to regulate. If nonperforming loans require a second bailout, the banking sector could become something like a regulated utility in some markets.\n\nA push to redefine the global public health ecosystem to better navigate possible future pandemics and related threats could provide additional impetus for cross-country public-sector intervention. In the same way that reform of financial institutions gained momentum in 2009, the same could be true for public health in the near future.\n\nAs McKinsey colleagues wrote in the context of climate change, “the tremendous costs of being the payor, lender, and insurer of last resort may prompt governments to take a much more active role in ensuring resiliency.” The implications for the role of the state will materially affect the way business is conducted; business leaders in many more sectors will have to adjust to the next normal of greater government intervention.\n\nAt some point, governments may decide to get out of the business of business; how they do so will be complicated and differentiated. How much, how fast, and in what ways governments reduce their economic role will be one of the most important questions of the next decade.\n\n5. More scrutiny for business\n\nRightly or wrongly, there is a perception in many countries that during the financial crisis, financial institutions were culpable for the trauma, accepted billions of dollars from taxpayers, and gave little back. Now citizens all over the world could face higher taxes and/or fewer services in order to pay for the $10.6 trillion committed so far. The public will expect—indeed, demand—that their money be used for the benefit of society at large. This raises complicated questions. What does it mean for businesses to do right by their employees and customers? If a financial institution accepts a bailout, how should it think about calling in loans? When, if ever, is it appropriate to resume buybacks and pay higher dividends?\n\nEven before the coronavirus, there was a growing sense that shareholder value should not be the only corporate value. In August 2019, more than 181 US CEOs signed a statement committing themselves to other priorities—investing in employees, supporting communities, and dealing ethically with suppliers—in addition to shareholder value. The idea of the “triple bottom line”—profit, people, and planet—has become mainstream, as have socially responsible investment funds.\n\nWith many businesses likely to be operating to some extent with public money, the scrutiny will be intense. There will be real effects on the relations between government and business, and between business and society. That could show itself in the form of more regulation, particularly in regard to domestic sourcing and workforce safety. And as the coronavirus reveals or heightens awareness of social fractures, business will be expected to be part of finding long-term solutions.\n\nThe coronavirus could be the biggest global challenge since World War II. In the wake of that conflict came the question: “What did you do during the war?” That question will be asked, forcefully, of both government and business, once the COVID-19 battle has been won. Business leaders need to ask it of themselves now.\n\n6. Changing industry structures, consumer behavior, market positions, and sector attractiveness\n\nOne of the key questions facing business leaders is whether their industry will rebound from the economic shock posed by the virus, or sustain lasting damage. The answer to this question likely lies in an assessment of the degree to which industries find themselves susceptible to the elements highlighted in this article. For example, those that have shown themselves to be less resilient may find it difficult to regain their pre-COVID-19 standing. In the auto sector, for example, companies have relied on global just-in-time-based supply chains; they will be under pressure to change so that continuity of supply is just as valued as cost and speed to market.\n\nIn addition, there could be lasting changes to consumer attitudes toward physical distance, health, and privacy. For example, increased health awareness and a corresponding desire to live more healthily could bring lasting change to where, how, and what people eat. Some consumers and governments—but by no means all—may change their attitudes toward the sharing and use of personal data if it can be demonstrated that the use of such data during the crisis helped safeguard lives.\n\nFor millennials and members of Generation Z—those born between 1980 and 2012—this crisis represents the biggest disruption they have faced. Their attitudes may be changed profoundly and in ways that are hard to predict. The tourism, travel, and hospitality sectors may see their businesses subject to long-term changes in business and individual travel preferences. Concern over the possibility of other “black swan” events could change how consumers approach financial security—saving more and spending less. The list of questions about how consumers will behave after COVID-19 is long, and uncertainty is high. As a result, this is the subject of much research by McKinsey and others.\n\nGiven the intensity of these pressures, it is reasonable to question whether existing market positions will be retained without significant effort to reposition and respond to changes confronting industries and sectors as a whole. To this can be added the economic impact of stretched balance sheets and valuations leading to changes in business ownership.\n\nIn this context, it is possible that institutions may find new and enduring ways to collaborate, prompted by the regulatory and other changes that have enabled corporations to work together in order to address the current crisis.\n\n7. Finding the silver linings\n\nIf necessity is the mother of invention—and it often is—there could be some positive outcomes of the coronavirus crisis. These are unlikely to come anywhere near to compensating for the human and economic toll it is wreaking. However, given the general shortage of optimism at the moment, it may be heartening to consider a few encouraging possibilities.\n\nOne has to do with the human imperative to communicate. In this sense, the death of distance continues to be very real, and very positive. Individuals, communities, businesses, and governments alike are all learning new ways to connect: almost everyone knows a story of the grandparent who finally learned to Zoom, Skype, or FaceTime.\n\nFor businesses, the consequences have been profound. Many have learned how to operate remotely—at a high level and at far greater speed. These practices could well stick, making for better management and more flexible workforces—something that could be particularly useful for many women, the disabled, and those who prefer untraditional career trajectories.\n\nBusiness leaders now have a better sense of what can, and cannot, be done outside their companies’ traditional processes. Many are beginning to appreciate the speed with which their organizations can move once they change how they do things. In short, the coronavirus is forcing both the pace and scale of workplace innovation. Indeed, as businesses are forced to do more with less, many are finding better, simpler, less expensive, and faster ways to operate.\n\nThe urgency of addressing COVID-19 has also led to innovations in biotech, vaccine development, and the regulatory regimes that govern drug development, so that treatments can be approved and tried faster. In many countries, health systems have been hard to reform; this crisis has made the difficult much easier to achieve. The result should be more resilient, responsive, and effective health systems.\n\nThese silver linings are thin compared with the scale of the coronavirus catastrophe. Nurturing a next normal that will be better than what it replaced will be a long-term test of all our institutions, global and local, public and private. It will be critical to reconstruct for the future and not solve for the problems of the past.\n\nOne possible next normal is that decisions made during and after the crisis lead to less prosperity, slower growth, widening inequality, bloated government bureaucracies, and rigid borders. Or it could be that the decisions made during this crisis lead to a burst of innovation and productivity, more resilient industries, smarter government at all levels, and the emergence of a reconnected world. Neither is inevitable; indeed, the outcome is probably more likely to be a mix. The point is that where the world lands is a matter of choice—of countless decisions to be made by individuals, companies, governments, and institutions.\n\nThe early 20th-century British explorer Ernest Shackleton once noted, “Optimism is true moral courage.” Optimism and courage: these qualities are needed more than ever as leaders make the decisions that will shape the next normal.", "keywords": ["businesses", "world", "crisis", "ways", "coronavirus", "global", "business", "normal", "possible", "shape", "future", "used", "thoughts", "companies", "health"], "summary": "Downloadable Resources Open interactive popupDealing with the coronavirus crisis and its aftermath could be the imperative of our times.\nMcKinsey research on the 2008 financial crisis found that a small group of companies in each sector outperformed their peers.\nAt some point, governments may decide to get out of the business of business; how they do so will be complicated and differentiated.\nFinding the silver liningsIf necessity is the mother of invention—and it often is—there could be some positive outcomes of the coronavirus crisis.\nIt will be critical to reconstruct for the future and not solve for the problems of the past.", "url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/leadership/the-future-is-not-what-it-used-to-be-thoughts-on-the-shape-of-the-next-normal", "rss_link": "http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/rss.aspx", "title": "The future is not what it used to be: Thoughts on the shape of the next normal"}, {"authors": ["Rahil Jogani", "Naufal Khan", "Wasim Lala", "Ranjani Ramaa", "Steve Van Kuiken", "About The Author S", "Rahil Jogani Is A Partner In Mckinsey S Chicago Office", "Where Naufal Khan Is A Senior Partner", "Ranjani Ramaa Is An Associate Partner", "Wasim Lala Is An Associate Partner In The New Jersey Office"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "Governments in many countries around the world are increasingly taking more stringent actions to contain the global COVID-19 pandemic. Strong measures, such as putting in place lockdown and shelter-in-place guidance, have shown promise in blunting the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nHowever, these measures are also creating specific challenges for CIOs in supporting their organizations and managing the implications of the crisis. Among the many actions CIOs must take in the first wave of their response—from reliably supporting a work-from-home workforce to keeping their colleagues safe to battling cyberattacks—they must also consider whether to manage their outsourced services to ensure business continuity in the light of global lockdowns or to better manage IT costs in anticipation of potentially challenging economic times.\n\nAs of this writing, for example, the Philippines (with more than 1.1 million call-center workers) has called for a lockdown for 47 days; similarly, India, a powerhouse in providing IT services (with an estimated 3.1 million call-center workers), has instituted a 40-day lockdown of the majority of business and government establishments. These measures have forced companies to react quickly. Outsourcing providers have placed orders for new laptops at significant volumes and, in the interim, have adopted tactical solutions such as shipping desktops to their employees’ homes. At the same time, demands on many outsourcing providers have increased. A media company, for example, had to quickly hire 500 people to manage the sharp rise in call waiting times and increased customer demand for broadband packages as more people worked from home.\n\nThe outsourcing industry has been an integral partner in companies’ crisis response across sectors. For example, a CIO was facing challenges with call-center support with the lockdown in the Philippines. The company’s service provider stepped in to move more than 50 percent of the call-center volumes from the Philippines to India—with no disruption to service or quality—in a matter of days. Such a move wouldn’t have been possible if the business had had to rely on its own internal operations. Considering the prevalence and scale of outsourcing in every industry and company, it is now critical for CIOs to work with their providers not only to manage immediate issues but also to position their businesses well for the emerging medium- and long-term implications.\n\nIn the past three weeks, we’ve spoken with multiple senior leaders at global companies and outsourcing providers to better understand what the most successful responses to the coronavirus crisis have been. Based on these conversations and our experience helping companies in previous crises, we believe CIOs should focus their energies and those of their outsourcing providers over the next 60 to 90 days on two areas: 1) resolving immediate issues and 2) building resilience and planning for ongoing COVID-19-related impact.\n\nWould you like to learn more about McKinsey Digital\n\nResolve immediate issues\n\nTake care of your people—including your outsourced team. Now is the time to be “one” team. COVID-19 is first and foremost a human tragedy. Like all other companies, outsourcing providers are focused on taking care of loved ones and trying to stay healthy while doing their jobs effectively under stressful and difficult conditions. This requires empathy and flexibility from CIOs.\n\nActions\n\nBring a human front to all provider interactions. Ask how they are ensuring their employees’ well-being, especially during lockdowns.\n\nWork with your providers to develop clear guidelines for the health of employees who need to remain on-site, such as dividing workspace into smaller zones that employees should not cross.\n\nAsk your providers to provide appropriate mental-health support to assist their employees in these challenging times (and, if possible, find ways to supplement the providers’ support).\n\nSecure services on critical infrastructure, systems, security, and processes that are essential to run your business. Current lockdown and remote-working operating models are putting unprecedented strains on every outsourcing provider’s infrastructure. Some of them, particularly smaller, more nimble players, may have furnished their employees with the right equipment to work at scale. Internet service providers in areas heavily affected by the coronavirus, however, are experiencing service degradation due to capacity overloads or lack of robust infrastructure—particularly true for India and the Philippines—which compromises the ability of their employees to log in to systems and provide support at high levels of productivity. Add to the mix the possibility that critical knowledge of your company’s infrastructure, security, processes, and systems may be entrusted to a provider employee who has no backup should he or she fall sick, and your organization’s technology ecosystem and business continuity could be at critical risk.\n\nWhile most CIOs have already taken immediate steps in response to the COVID-19 situation, a deeper integration with outsourcing providers on crisis-response actions should be considered.\n\nActions\n\nEnsure critical provider employees in lockdown can effectively work remotely. Even though most providers have enabled their workforce to work from home, CIOs need to track workforce productivity and the ability to work in real time. Make sure that your providers scale up key enablers, such as: 1) work protocols (roles and responsibilities, decision rights, issue management); 2) processes (communications, workflow); 3) technology (network bandwidth, virtual private network [VPN], collaboration tools, video conferences, security); and 4) people management (health tracking and support). Establish daily crisis-response calls with your outsourcing providers until the new working model proves itself.\n\nEven though most providers have enabled their workforce to work from home, CIOs need to track workforce productivity and the ability to work in real time.

Establish daily crisis-response calls with your outsourcing providers until the new working model proves itself. Plan for capacity rebalancing with your outsourcing provider. Work with your providers to understand current capacity and to plan for the future impact of any declines in productivity. For example, productivity in infrastructure support is expected to drop by as much as 40–50 percent due to a lack of remote infrastructure availability. Design and implement possible rebalancing plans between locations and/or providers. Initially, this may need to be done weekly, since each country might be at a different stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. A company might, for example, move work to Eastern Europe as India and the Philippines go into lockdown. Encourage your providers to provide early warning about impacted resources and services.\n\nWork with your providers to understand current capacity and to plan for the future impact of any declines in productivity.

Set up and confirm compliance with the right offshore security protocols. It’s critical to ensure that all provider employees safeguard and handle all data, especially personally identifiable information (PII), the right way, even in remote locations. CIOs should make sure that providers have safe remote-working protocols and procedures for threat identification and escalation. Consider, for example, using multifactor authentication to derisk access to sensitive data and working with providers to shorten patch cycles for essential work-from-home systems such as VPNs and endpoint protection to reduce the risk of data being stored at endpoint devices while considering latency issues.\n\nIt’s critical to ensure that all provider employees safeguard and handle all data, especially personally identifiable information (PII), the right way, even in remote locations.

Set up a virtual command center. CIOs need to pull together a team to help ensure technology uptime and enable critical “crisis-time” business requirements—mission-critical systems, inventory data availability, and payments, for example. Some of these may require changes to systems for remote business users. Stalled workflows may need to be adapted; instead of printing invoices, for example, perhaps scan them to PDF in a shared folder.\n\n\n\nOne public-sector organization set up a command center in a matter of days to identify and support critical business needs. It also tracked and reported on all critical system-usage metrics, such as number of transactions, by remote users. This allowed it to proactively identify and resolve bottlenecks.\n\nCIOs need to pull together a team to help ensure technology uptime and enable critical “crisis-time” business requirements—mission-critical systems, inventory data availability, and payments, for example.

Rapidly reduce noncritical demand and usage in the short term to ease the burden. While most outsourcing providers are running at full production capacity without a significant drop in service levels, they will likely run into capacity shortages as the lockdowns continue. Ensure that available capacity is being wisely used. Reassess all applications for true criticality and 24/7 support, reduce service-level agreements for nonpriority tickets, and, if facing network issues, move to audio conferences as opposed to video conferences.\n\nWhile most outsourcing providers are running at full production capacity without a significant drop in service levels, they will likely run into capacity shortages as the lockdowns continue.

Reassess all applications for true criticality and 24/7 support, reduce service-level agreements for nonpriority tickets, and, if facing network issues, move to audio conferences as opposed to video conferences. Ensure business process outsourcings (BPOs), call centers, and help desks are ready for increased volume and crisis-related customer questions. Many call centers and other support services have seen a surge in calls even as capacity is under pressure from lockdowns and quarantines. CIOs should share weekly workload forecasts with providers and work with them to identify options to address potential surge capacity, including how they will increase staff as needed. CIOs should also work proactively with the business side to identify and address emerging customer and employee FAQs and craft communications for providers. One banking organization, for example, realized that high call volumes were from customers who wanted to refinance their mortgages, but the call-center operators had no guidance on how to respond.\n\nThe CIO’s moment: Leadership through the first wave of the coronavirus crisis\n\nBuild resilience for ongoing COVID-19 effects\n\nProactively collaborate with your outsourcing providers to prepare for what’s next. Once the critical needs have been addressed, CIOs should then be proactive with their providers in addressing the likely ongoing effects of this crisis. These might include business-continuity planning for possible capacity reduction, dealing with issues around remote work on critical technology programs, and developing approaches to address new needs as they emerge.\n\nActions\n\nBuild real-time crisis-monitoring dashboards across all outsourced services.

What if networks in India deteriorate rapidly under high loads, for example? Develop specific mitigation plans: Could the provider move critical activities to on-site facilities and balance the load across various services? Reallocate resources to critical projects. Work with your providers and business partners to identify and prioritize technology solutions that are critical for the business and its customers—critical patient journeys in healthcare systems, perhaps, or inventory and supply-chain analytics for retailers. Ask your providers to find out if there are common “industry” solutions that you can benefit from. Consider reallocating resources from projects that are no longer a priority to those that are.\n\nHave honest discussions with your providers on the financial impact of the COVID-19 crisis, with the goal of finding the best outcomes for everyone. As companies come to terms with the human toll of the COVID-19 crisis, they also need to work closely with their providers to work through the financial implications and find solutions that can benefit both parties.\n\nActions\n\nAssess the long-term partnership with providers. As CIOs consider the financial costs of the crisis and assess ways to better manage spend, there will be strong temptations to cut back on some outsourcing. To properly assess the relationship with their providers, CIOs will need to take a hard look at their road map and the capabilities they will need in the future, once the recovery starts. Knee-jerk cost cutting may incur greater costs later.\n\nAs CIOs consider the financial costs of the crisis and assess ways to better manage spend, there will be strong temptations to cut back on some outsourcing. To properly assess the relationship with their providers, CIOs will need to take a hard look at their road map and the capabilities they will need in the future, once the recovery starts. Knee-jerk cost cutting may incur greater costs later. Work with your providers to improve your financial resilience. Assess how providers can help your organization weather the crisis, perhaps by adjusting the mix of labor in locations, pushing out payments, or implementing lean transformations. Understand each party’s needs and set up financial arrangements accordingly. For example, one organization changed the spend mix from capital expenditures to operating expenditures with its provider, thus providing immediate cash benefits to its provider—in return for favorable in-year credits redeemable at the end of the year or in the following year. Explore all options to cut discretionary spending from the contracts, even minor spending, such as travel and expense line items.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has clearly highlighted the need for critical technology resilience and strong partnerships with outsourcing providers, and it may dramatically shape the nature of the outsourcing industry for years to come. Business-continuity planning with providers, for example, will not merely be a “check the box” exercise but an area of differentiation defined by such concerns as how quickly a provider can lift and shift workloads across geographies.\n\nBecoming comfortable with remote working also potentially provides CIOs with an opportunity to accelerate the shift to new operating models. Being able to work with talent in any location can empower teams to work successfully without in-person face time, institutionalize agile application-development methodologies for distributed or remote work at scale, build support models with the flexibility to ramp up and down quickly across locations, and potentially increase outsourcing of nonstrategic and back-office services. In some cases, it may also make sense to work with outsourcing providers with the capabilities to accelerate important transformational programs, such as the shift to digital channels or development of new business models. One organization, for example, is now putting together a task force with providers to automate its paper-based invoice-reconciliation processes, which was previously done manually by 40 to 50 full-time employees.\n\nWhatever the path, CIOs will need to work in true partnership with their outsourcing providers to change the delivery of technology services not only to manage this crisis but also to power the business forward.", "keywords": ["example", "capacity", "need", "crisis", "navigate", "outsourcing", "coronavirus", "business", "support", "work", "cios", "critical", "providers"], "summary": "In the past three weeks, we’ve spoken with multiple senior leaders at global companies and outsourcing providers to better understand what the most successful responses to the coronavirus crisis have been.\nAsk your providers to provide appropriate mental-health support to assist their employees in these challenging times (and, if possible, find ways to supplement the providers’ support).\nCurrent lockdown and remote-working operating models are putting unprecedented strains on every outsourcing provider’s infrastructure.\nEstablish daily crisis-response calls with your outsourcing providers until the new working model proves itself.\nEstablish daily crisis-response calls with your outsourcing providers until the new working model proves itself.", "url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-cios-can-work-with-outsourcing-providers-to-navigate-the-coronavirus", "rss_link": "http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/rss.aspx", "title": "How CIOs can work with outsourcing providers to navigate the coronavirus crisis"}, {"authors": ["Sabine Becker", "Stacey Haas", "Eric Kuehl", "Ignacio Marcos", "Kumar Venkataraman", "About The Author S", "Sabine Becker Is A Consultant In Mckinsey S Zurich Office", "Stacey Haas Is A Partner In The Detroit Office", "Eric Kuehl Is", "A Consultant In The Chicago Office"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "With much of the world’s population being asked or required to stay home and follow physical-distancing guidelines, once-bustling restaurants and cafés now sit empty. Although a few quick-service restaurants (QSRs) are seeing heightened demand in takeout and delivery—several US pizza chains, for instance, are hiring thousands of workers as orders spike—most other QSRs have experienced dramatic sales declines. Some have closed their doors for good.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is a humanitarian crisis whose economic impact will almost certainly be severe as well. As our colleagues wrote in a recent article, “The required ‘lockdowns’ of the population and other efforts to control the virus are likely to lead to the largest quarterly decline in economic activity since 1933.” They expect an unprecedented 40 to 50 percent decline in discretionary spending—a roughly 10 percent reduction in GDP. (See McKinsey.com/coronavirus for our most up-to-date insights.)\n\nThe QSR industry has been hit particularly hard. A few restaurants have already declared bankruptcy; others report that they soon won’t be able to cover their rent and personnel costs. In the United States alone, up to seven million restaurant workers could lose their jobs by June, according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nUndeniably, QSRs face tough decisions in the coming weeks and months. But some QSRs will fare better than others, depending on their starting point and the actions their leadership teams take. This article lays out a series of practices—critical for “navigating the now,” planning the comeback, and shaping the future—that can help QSRs not just survive the current crisis but also position themselves to succeed in the “next normal.”\n\nCOVID-19’s impact on consumer behavior\n\nIn many countries, QSRs are either closed entirely or operating on a limited basis, offering only takeout, pickup, delivery, drive-through, or some combination of those options. Even among QSRs that remain open, the drop-off in business has been steep. Consumer-sentiment surveys that McKinsey conducted in late March across Europe and the United States indicate that during the crisis, most consumers expect to reduce their spending on all restaurant food—takeout and delivery, QSRs, and other types of restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, where physical-distancing restrictions have already been loosened, consumer-sentiment surveys reveal the following three trends (exhibit) that could play out in other geographies as well:\n\nPostcrisis spending on in-restaurant dining is expected to be lower than precrisis levels, largely because consumers will still be wary of being in densely populated public spaces.\n\nDemand for takeout is expected to return to precrisis levels fairly quickly.\n\nAfter the pandemic, consumers will likely spend more on food delivery, prepared foods, and groceries than they did before the pandemic. Again, because of financial strains and lingering concerns about eating in crowded places, consumers will likely continue to prefer eating at home, at least for a time.\n\nExhibit We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nThe specific challenges each QSR faces during this crisis are unique, depending on the company’s financial and market position and the pandemic’s timing and progression in local markets. But every company can take inspiration from what some of its counterparts around the world are doing.\n\nActions to consider, both for now and for later\n\nDrawing on lessons from the past several weeks, we have identified a set of actions for QSR executives to consider during these challenging times.\n\n‘Navigate the now’: Short-term priorities\n\nWhile QSRs should stay abreast of how the situation evolves, they should take immediate action in certain critical areas. Short-term priorities for QSRs during the crisis include the following:\n\nProtecting employees and customers\n\nBy now, most QSR players have established new health and safety processes and policies to protect employees and customers. Some of the practices QSRs have implemented include adjusting travel policies to permit only the most critical business travel, encouraging or requiring remote working for corporate staff, and amending sick-leave policies for employees affected by COVID-19. QSRs have also adjusted their on-site offerings to follow local and national guidelines—for example, by shutting down self-serve prepared-food counters, suspending all customer events, and switching to a delivery-only model.\n\nWith regard to hygiene and safety, QSRs have instituted strict protocols, such as providing hand sanitizer and thermometers and training employees to minimize human contact. In addition, most QSRs have increased the frequency and rigor of in-store cleanings, making sure to sanitize high-touch areas (such as counters, self-checkout screens, and door handles on coolers and freezers).\n\nSafeguarding the top line\n\nDespite physical-distancing regulations, restaurants can continue to generate sales. In localities that prohibit on-premise dining, QSRs have ramped up their takeout and delivery capabilities and adopted new marketing tactics to reach consumers who may not actively be searching for these services.\n\nDoubling down on the online channel. Many QSRs that built their own online-ordering mechanisms on their websites or mobile apps are working to make sure these can handle an increase in demand. Meanwhile, companies that don’t have their own online capabilities are partnering with call centers, delivery aggregators, and other third-party providers—though serving customers through such partnerships yields significantly lower margins (because aggregators, for instance, typically take 25 to 30 percent of the value of each transaction). In either case, restaurants are finding that they need to expand their delivery fleets. Some are reassigning in-store employees to assist with delivery operations.\n\nSimplifying kitchen operations while meeting customers’ changing needs. During this crisis, consumers have become more willing to have a broad array of food products delivered to their homes. For example, beverages, bread, and fruit—products that consumers have historically preferred to consume in restaurants or buy in grocery stores—now increasingly appear in restaurant-delivery orders. Some restaurants are therefore expanding their delivery menus, giving customers more choices in both fresh and prepared foods and even, in some cases, offering meal kits that customers can put together at home. However, QSRs recognize the need to simplify their operations to avoid putting further stress on an already-strained workforce. They are therefore striving to meet new consumer needs without making kitchen operations more complex.\n\nSending targeted customer communications. Communicating with customers is especially important for QSRs during this time, as restaurants face increased competition from home cooking. With people spending almost all their time at home, QSRs are shifting their marketing spend to home-based channels, such as TV or online, and from sports channels to news outlets. They are also securing preferred placement in food-delivery apps. In addition, some QSRs are engaging with trade associations and industry experts to ensure the appropriateness and accuracy of their marketing messages (for instance, in ads emphasizing safety of food delivery or takeout).\n\nStabilizing the supply chain\n\nRestaurants need a reliable supply chain—not just for food ingredients but also for essential supplies to keep the business running: disposable paper goods (such as napkins and food cartons), cleaning products, spare parts for the vans and motorbikes used for food deliveries, and so forth. To minimize the risk of disruption in the supply chain, QSRs are taking a range of actions, such as limiting menus to match what they can predictably source, substituting frozen products for fresh products when necessary, revising purchase orders to align with demand, identifying alternate suppliers, and collaborating with manufacturers to create contingency plans. To support small and midsize suppliers that might be struggling during the crisis, some cash-rich QSRs are adjusting payment terms or offering temporary loan options. A handful of forward-thinking QSRs are also taking advantage of historically low commodity prices (of oil and chicken, for instance) by purchasing ahead where possible or by pre-booking freight capacity.\n\nManaging cash\n\nMost QSRs can expect to generate only a small fraction of their normal revenues for the foreseeable future, so cash management is a clear priority. Some QSRs have established a “cash lab”—a central team with full visibility into cash forecasting and optimization. The cash lab stays on top of regulatory developments in each market so that, where appropriate, the company can receive government aid, benefit from tax deferrals or credits, or apply for federal loans as quickly as possible.\n\nTo conserve cash, QSR leaders are postponing or renegotiating rent payments, deferring noncritical indirect spend and capital expenditures, and reducing personnel costs through hiring freezes and efforts to take advantage of government-funded programs, such as Germany’s Kurzarbeit, or “short-time work” wage subsidy. In addition, they are preparing clear and detailed messages for investors about their plans for generating cash and the timing of those initiatives.\n\nModeling a range of scenarios\n\nWhen will people start eating in restaurants again? The answer will be different everywhere—but we expect the mandated closures to extend beyond the dates originally announced, at least in Europe and the United States. And we expect that, for health and safety reasons, restaurant dining rooms will be among the last businesses that will be allowed to reopen. The timing of recovery will also vary by country. We see China recovering ahead of many western countries including Italy and the United States.\n\nFor QSR players with locations in multiple markets, one crucial exercise is to model three-month, six-month, and 12-month scenarios for each market and to develop concrete action plans for every scenario. If, for instance, restaurants remain shut in six months’ time, QSRs may need to reduce fixed costs drastically by renegotiating leases and credit terms or by selling real estate. If restaurant closures last even longer than six months, some companies may need to seek new lines of credit, divest business units, or even put themselves up for sale.\n\nIdeally, this kind of scenario modeling and contingency planning will be among the responsibilities of a COVID-19 nerve center—a cross-functional team that has access to real-time data on how the situation is evolving. This team helps ensure that company leaders are aligned on the scenarios as well as on the portfolio of actions for each scenario.\n\nPlan the comeback: Medium-term actions\n\nAs stay-at-home mandates begin to lift and restaurants reopen, QSRs will need to have plans in place to capture returning demand. A return to previous demand levels won’t happen right away, so QSRs will need to take a phased approach to bringing back labor, dine-in operations, and supply-chain support.\n\nIn the immediate postcrisis period, we see QSR companies choosing between two sets of strategic actions, depending largely on each QSR’s financial and competitive position. Companies with low liquidity and weak competitive differentiators would need to pursue “preserve and grow” actions. On the other hand, companies with strong financial fundamentals and competitive advantages can aggressively build on their strengths. QSR companies that entered the crisis from a position of strength will, of course, have more options and greater flexibility in preparing for the recovery.\n\n‘Preserve and grow’\n\nSome QSRs entered the crisis in an already precarious cash position. Broadly speaking, these players tend to have a few attributes in common: a heavy reliance on their brick-and-mortar restaurants, a minimal presence in digital and delivery channels, menus that aren’t sufficiently differentiated from those of competitors, and limited loyalty programs. They also tend to be more prone to supply-chain instability because of a small and dispersed supplier base.\n\nDuring the crisis, these companies will be focused on avoiding bankruptcy; they need to find ways of adapting their offerings while conserving cash. But even during the recovery period, cash-poor restaurants will need to keep instilling a cash-conscious culture at all levels of the organization. They’ll need to remain vigilant with their spending, in part as a cautionary measure in the event of a resurgence of the coronavirus. For these companies, continuing to create weekly cash-flow projections and to conduct financial-health evaluations regularly across the network will be important. They also should consider renegotiating contracts to increase flexibility—for example, by tying rent to revenue.\n\nAt the same time, cash-constrained QSRs should constantly communicate with their customers, particularly their most loyal ones, who will be their best lever for increasing demand once restaurants reopen. To make sure that brand communications are consistently sensitive and will resonate with the customer base, QSRs should run frequent “pulse checks” on consumer sentiment.\n\nAnd of course, an important “preserve and grow” action for QSRs will be to continue to prioritize hygiene and safety while controlling costs. Companies will need to establish stringent labor processes and schedules in their restaurants; some might consider simplifying menus to further reduce complexity in kitchen operations.\n\n‘Build on strengths’\n\nOther QSRs, by contrast, entered the crisis with strong liquidity positions. These financially stable companies tend to have well-established digital and delivery channels and strong loyalty programs. Most have invested in the supply chain by building up a stable supplier base and developing contingency plans to minimize supply-chain disruptions in times of crisis.\n\nDuring the recovery, these companies can accelerate growth by increasing their investments in mobile and delivery solutions, offering value-meal and family-meal promotions, and focusing on occasions that saw the biggest declines during the crisis (such as breakfast on the way to work). They can entice customers to return to on-premise dining with attractive promotions and new menu offerings. They might also consider launching task forces to conduct competitive scans: in some markets, competitors may either be struggling or have closed locations. QSRs could step up their marketing efforts in those areas to capture market share.\n\nStronger companies can also leverage their cash positions for disruptive moves: they might, for instance, make anticyclical investments, purchase real estate, or acquire distressed competitors, business units, or brands. As QSR companies seek to form partnerships or make acquisitions, they should consider not just economic rationales but social rationales as well—for example, could a particular M&A deal keep another company afloat, save jobs in a struggling community, or strengthen the restaurant industry for the longer term?\n\nShape the next normal: Long-term considerations\n\nAs the crisis subsides, all QSRs must prepare for the coming shifts, in consumer mindsets and behavior, that will shape the industry’s next normal. The following are some of the changes we believe are possible:\n\nGreater concern about hygiene and safety. Consumers will demand much more information about what ingredients are in restaurant food, where it comes from, how it’s prepared, and by whom. Sanitization will become a significant focus for restaurants; day-to-day operating costs will increase as a result. Food-packaging costs may also rise. Contactless delivery and pickup may become the norm.\n\nStronger demand for digital and delivery. The competitive landscape in food delivery will be transformed as QSR players build internal capabilities, invest in next-generation technology (such as delivery drones), or join forces with third-party providers. Loyalty programs will become more robust as QSRs look to increase “stickiness” among customers. Some QSRs may also reformat their locations—for instance, by shrinking seating areas and increasing drive-through capacity.\n\nShift in spending from QSRs to grocery stores. Early signs indicate that some of the shift from spending in restaurants to spending in grocery stores will persist in a post-coronavirus world. To supplement these losses, QSRs can look for additional revenue streams; more QSR players may, for example, consider launching grocery product lines or expanding into new channels, such as B2B catering. In response to lower sales levels, some QSRs may also consider reevaluating their corporate costs, restaurant networks, and franchisee base.\n\nIncreased focus on supply-chain management. The COVID-19 crisis is exposing weaknesses in many QSR supply chains and highlighting the importance of flexibility and adaptability. This challenge will galvanize QSRs to invest in supply-chain technology and capacity so that they can better—and more rapidly—align supply with demand. Many QSRs also experienced supply-chain disruptions as a result of labor shortages during the crisis, and that may lead them to accelerate their investments in supply-chain automation.\n\nQSRs need an operating model that can accommodate the extreme level of uncertainty facing the industry. Two practical steps they can take to guide their decision making are to launch a “plan-ahead team” and to direct that team to work across multiple time horizons.\n\nThe QSR business, by definition, is about serving customers at speed. We believe that if QSRs act quickly in this crisis to meet the changing needs of consumers while prioritizing people’s health and well-being, QSRs can not only withstand these difficult times but also build valuable capabilities for resilience and success in the future.", "keywords": ["times", "restaurants", "delivery", "matters", "crisis", "need", "coronavirus", "consumers", "qsrs", "demand", "delivering", "customers", "quickservice", "qsr", "companies"], "summary": "Although a few quick-service restaurants (QSRs) are seeing heightened demand in takeout and delivery—several US pizza chains, for instance, are hiring thousands of workers as orders spike—most other QSRs have experienced dramatic sales declines.\nDuring this crisis, consumers have become more willing to have a broad array of food products delivered to their homes.\nCommunicating with customers is especially important for QSRs during this time, as restaurants face increased competition from home cooking.\nBut even during the recovery period, cash-poor restaurants will need to keep instilling a cash-conscious culture at all levels of the organization.\nQSRs need an operating model that can accommodate the extreme level of uncertainty facing the industry.", "url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/delivering-when-it-matters-quick-service-restaurants-in-coronavirus-times", "rss_link": "http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/rss.aspx", "title": "Delivering when it matters: Quick-service restaurants in coronavirus times"}, {"authors": ["Sven Smit", "Martin Hirt", "Kevin Buehler", "Susan Lund", "Ezra Greenberg", "Arvind Govindarajan", "About The Author S", "Sven Smit Is A Senior Partner In Mckinsey S Amsterdam Office", "A Cochair", "Director Of The Mckinsey Global Institute"], "publish_date": "nil", "text": "Downloadable Resources Open interactive popup\n\nWorking from their homes, thousands of executives worldwide assessed McKinsey’s scenarios on recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The nine scenarios were first presented in our article, “Safeguarding our lives and our livelihoods: The imperative of our time.” They estimate three likely paths for the spread of the virus and the public-health response, and three potential levels of effectiveness for governmental economic response.\n\nThese results come against the backdrop of a dramatic humanitarian crisis evolving at a global scale, with nearly two million infected by the virus, tens of thousands of lives lost, and tens of millions of people now unemployed in the midst of the fastest and deepest recession in living memory.\n\nOut of the nine scenarios describing the economic impact of the crisis and the recovery period, the clearest survey result was the respondent preference for the scenario defined by a (regional) recurrence of the virus after containment, a muted recovery, and slower long-term growth. This scenario is labeled A1 in the exhibit below, where alphanumeric labels (not seen by the respondents) are overlaid. The shaded scenarios, labeled A1 to A4, reflect those outcomes in which both the public-health and economic-policy responses are adequate or better. The B1 to B5 scenarios reflect outcomes in which the responses are ineffective in one or both domains (public health and economic policy).\n\nExhibit We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nRespondents were asked to rank three scenarios in order of likelihood. The scenario they thought most likely, A1, suggests that respondents see interventions in both the public-health and economic-policy dimensions as partially effective in recovering our lives and livelihoods, and that the return to preoutbreak levels for GDP, income, and corporate earnings will take time. After A1, the most prevalent choice was A3, a stronger scenario in which the virus is contained and the pace of economic growth slowly recovers toward preoutbreak norms.\n\nAll together, 59 percent of respondents selected more optimistic A scenarios as their lead choice, and 41 percent chose B scenarios. Of the executive respondents selecting B scenarios as their lead choice, 29 percent chose scenarios in the first column, suggesting ineffective economic-policy responses as the significant failing in this crisis; 14 percent chose scenarios emphasizing the failure of public-health interventions.\n\nAnother notable result is that respondents from China, which moved through the crisis first, expressed more positive views, with 28 percent (as opposed to 12 percent) choosing the scenarios projecting the strongest growth rebound (A2 and A4). Respondents from Europe, the United States, and Asia–Pacific strongly favored A1 as their most likely scenario, reflecting the general sober assessment of both viral containment and economic recovery.\n\nLet’s be clear: none of these scenarios is good news. All of them describe a global health and economic crisis of proportions not seen since World War II. Most executives seem to have internalized this assessment. They hold balanced views regarding possible outcomes, expressing the anxiety we all share toward possibly worse recovery paths, especially in developing economies.\n\nThe dual imperative of safeguarding lives and livelihoods is a challenge to the world to combat the virus and ensure that people can get safely back to work as soon as possible. The world is now embracing this challenge. Governments and many private organizations are rapidly developing innovative public-health responses to fight the virus and help those affected. Governments are deploying their vast resources at record speeds, to cushion the economic blow of the lockdowns. Corporate leaders around the world are now working on the safety protocols to be followed once they are allowed to restart their businesses. The virus will be present for months to come. Coexisting with it while operating businesses safely for employees and customers will be the most important step for getting the economy back on a path to recovery.\n\nWe will continue to report on this survey, with more depth and data by scenario.

Every new headline, every new hysteria is making people more nervous and it’s actually very, very positive,” he said, recommending that viewers borrow against their mortgages to buy stocks.\n\nAndrew Sandler, holed up with family, dogs and pet fish on New York’s Long Island, couldn’t resist a shot at his little brother on Facebook.\n\n“I think he’s wrong,” Andrew posted immediately after the TV appearance.\n\nThe depth and duration of COVID-19’s economic impact is a subject of debate among families the world over. But for Ricky and Andrew Sandler, their diverging views have broader implications: both run multi-billion dollar stock-focused hedge funds.\n\nTheir different outlooks — time to buy or stay cautious — have meant double-digit losses for Ricky’s $7.6 billion Eminence Capital LP and double-digit gains for Andrew’s nearly $2 billion unit of Sandler Capital Management.\n\nIt’s a scenario playing out across Wall Street. The coronavirus killed off the longest-running bull market in equities, meaning most hedge funds are nursing losses, with the average stock-focused fund down about 9.5% in March and 13% lower for the first quarter, according to data tracker HFR.\n\nA small number of hedge fund managers who positioned in time for the fallout have profited, few more than Andrew Sandler. The elder Sandler brother was one of the best performing hedge fund managers in the world for the first quarter, according to a ranking by HSBC.\n\nTo be sure, when markets recover, investors who held or added to their stock holdings may generate large gains, but the timing of such a payoff is uncertain.\n\nRepresentatives for Andrew and Ricky declined to comment and would not make them available for interview.\n\nDOWNSIDE RISKS\n\nThe Sandler brothers followed their late father, Harvey, into investment management in the 1990s. Andrew joined the family firm while Ricky set up his own fund. Until recently the brothers, now in their early 50s, worked a few blocks apart in midtown Manhattan offices.\n\nRicky, a cycling enthusiast who alternates between athletic apparel and power neckties, is comfortable in the spotlight. He routinely appears at gatherings of Wall Street’s elite, such as the Milken Institute’s annual confab in Beverly Hills and Allen & Co’s Sun Valley conference, and sometimes mounts public campaigns against companies.\n\nSelf-described as risk averse, Andrew is more low-key, avoiding the hedge fund speaking circuit in favor of tending to a 17,000 gallon basement aquarium.\n\nIn contrast to his younger brother, Andrew’s caution meant he missed out on the full market surge of recent years. His Sandler Plus fund gained just 2.75% in 2019, according to an investor letter, compared to a gain of nearly 14% by the average stock focused fund.\n\nThat all changed this year. Andrew had positioned his funds defensively, writing to investors on January 16 that “we remain concerned about valuations and downside risks the market seems to be ignoring.”\n\nAndrew was soon reducing market exposure even further, in part because of a rapidly spreading virus in China.\n\n“The Coronavirus could serve as a catalyst for disappointing global growth as well as specifically disrupt certain supply chains and consumer businesses,” the firm noted in a January 28 Lyxor/Sandler U.S. Equity Fund report.\n\nAndrew’s positioning was ideal when stocks started their rapid decline in late February: his funds had more bets on stocks declining than on them rising that month, according to a February 25 Lyxor report.\n\nIt also noted increased bets on healthcare stocks and a reduction in consumer discretionary businesses, which have been particularly hard hit as governments curtailed economic activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nAndrew’s Sandler Plus funds surged approximately 9.5% in March, putting its year-to-date performance at nearly 15%, according to an investor update reviewed by Reuters.\n\n‘TAKE HEED’\n\nOn March 16, the same day that Ricky took to CNBC to talk up the markets, Andrew warned a friend that he was not surprised by 1,000 point single day declines for major stock indexes. “Going to be more. Stay liquid my man. This is fucked up,” he wrote on Facebook.\n\nRicky came out of 2019 optimistic. As U.S. stocks surged, Eminence’s main hedge fund gained 21% in 2019 with a bullish net portfolio exposure of 47% in July, according to Institutional Investor.\n\nEminence’s exact positioning in late February was not available, but by the time Ricky went on CNBC in mid-March, his fund had suffered losses of more than 30%, according to an investor with direct knowledge of the performance.\n\nEminence’s top holdings at yearend, according to the most recent regulatory filing, included Versace apparel parent Capri Holdings Limited, chemical maker Ashland Global Holdings Inc. and motorsports giant Liberty Media Formula One; those stocks suffered first quarter price declines of between 35% and 72%.\n\nRicky told clients on a call in late March that he was leaning into his positions and remained bullish on the portfolio, according to the investor. Eminence performance rebounded slightly by the end of the month, putting the fund down 19% for the first quarter, according to the investor.\n\nReuters could not determine if Eminence has changed its investment strategy since the end of the first quarter; a representative for the firm declined to comment on that or recent performance.\n\nRicky was still bullish and predicted a 10% stock market rise from current levels by the yearend in an April 7 video discussion hosted by the University of Wisconsin.\n\nMajor U.S stock indices have risen between 7% and 12% since the beginning of April.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the Sandler brothers discuss the markets.
